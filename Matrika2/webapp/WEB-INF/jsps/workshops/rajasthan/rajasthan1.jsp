        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Ramratni: I have been working as a health worker in Urmul since
                1993. Thrice, I got training. I learnt everything about delivery and have also attended
                2-3<i>japas</i> (birth). I have also worked with <i>Dai</i>.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Veena: I have been working in this organization since 1986. I
                am an old worker of Urmul. Initially I was working on health programs. I was in
                health program when </span>
        </p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Dr. Sunil Kaul was there. I have done lot of work on <i>Dai</i>
                Training. These days I am doing work for sponsorship.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Kanta: I am in Urmul since 31st July 1997. I am not working in
                any specific program. These days I am doing lot of work on health.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Savitri: I have been working since 1993. I am working on health
                program.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Santosh Mati: I am working since 1996. I have two villages, Rajasar
                and Makrasar. I am doing health programs in these two regions.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Paana: I am working since 1993.<br />
                (Matrika team members introduce themselves)</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Madhu: We are not going to tell the <i>Dai</i> anything special
                because they know more then us. We want to know and understand their skills and
                the situation in which you work. In our first meeting (February 1998) with you,
                we felt that <i>Dais</i> tradition is breaking and therefore we have to understand
                these circumstances. For instance, all the <i>Dai</i> in all our workshop said that
                they cut <i>naal</i> (cord) after the <i>anwal </i>(placenta) is expelled but in
                your training which is based on doctors method, you ask the <i>Dai</i> to cut the
                cord the moment baby is expelled.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Satyanarayan: The question on whether it is right or wrong arises
                when we give training to <i>Dai</i>. This is because we are following doctor's
                model and also the books.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Deepti: This is because no model has been made based on <i>Dai</i>
                skills.<br />
                Satyanarayan: With our training they are loosing their traditional skills because
                we do not have confidence in their skills. Therefore we are not being able to do
                anything. There is a need of a new model for <i>Dai</i> training. Matrika should
                help us in this. The present model was made by Dr. Sunil Kaul and is 10-12 years
                old.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Deepti: Based on the books, the doctors' model was prevalent
                all over the world but now everyone is being told to go back to traditional system.
                The need is to merge the traditional and modern system.
                <br />
                Satyanarayan: Even we have started feeling this because the <i>Dai</i> also feels
                in the same way. Matrika should see this and help us.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Deepti: <i>Dai</i> is losing some important things and we have
                to save them. We cannot impose anything on <i>Dai</i> till we know their work completely.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Madhu: The spreading of <i>reth </i>(sand) is linked to this question.
                We know nothing about the usage of sand we are hearing about it for the first time.
                But I feel there must be some very important reason for this tradition of using
                sand. We are not sure if it is wrong or right but the reason for discontinuing it
                because it might lead to white discharge needs to be investigated.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Satyanarayan: The sand was cleaner before but it is not so clean
                any longer therefore we stop <i>Dai</i> from using it.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Deepti: But is the cloth clean?</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Santosh: Yes, this is a question and here people prefer to spread
                <i>mitti</i>(earth, and people here use the term <i>mitti</i> for sand) because
                it is warm. <i>Dai</i> usually make use of clean <i>mitti</i> .</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Satyanarayan: But we feel that the baby falls on the<i>mitti</i>
                and even the woman's <i>shareer</i> (body) touches the same <i>mitti</i>so
                definitely it can lead to infection. In future we will observe this more carefully.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Madhu: In our 3 days workshop we will talk about all these things.
                We will put more stress on their traditional skills. How they learnt and when they
                learnt. What are the problems that they face?</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Santosh: In the workshop, mostly traditional <i>Dai</i> who have
                been working for a long time are coming. Village people know them very well. When
                we go for our fieldwork we stay in their houses. So we have a good relationship
                and they will openly speak.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Madhu: The biggest problem in the workshop will be language. Only
                I know <i>Marwari </i>so we will completely rely on you all.</span></p>
        <p align="justify">
            <span class="default">Satyanarayan: This will not be a problem. Savitri and Santosh
                will help you in facilitation and Ramratni and Kanta will help in documentation.
                Four of them will always be with you and will help in organizing.<br />

            Madhu: We have come here to learn about <i>Dai</i> work because we are losing the
            traditional knowledge of <i>Dai</i>. Doctors are using their own methods. So we
            want to talk about <i>Dai</i> traditional knowledge, which is closer to the culture
            of the local people.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Ramratni (addresses the <i>Dai</i>): This is Matrika team and they work with <i>Dai</i>.
            They have come here to learn about your work, the different ways in which you handle
            <i>japa</i> (birth).
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Rami: I have been doing <i>Dai’s</i> work for the past 40 years. For last two years
            I have been with Urmul. I learnt <i>Dai</i>' work at home, from neighbors and
            from elderly women. First I handled delivery of my <i>Bahu</i>s (daughter-in-law)
            and of my daughters. Then started handling delivery of neighbors. Till now, no case
            has been spoiled by my hands nor has anyone complained about my work. I have not
            taken any <i>jacha </i>(pregnant woman) outside. After associating with the organization
            (Urmul) I learnt that <i>mitti</i> should not be spread during birth (delivery on
            the sand floor). And to use <i>Mamta kit </i>(<i>Dai’s</i> birth kit received in
            training contains blade, thread, soap, plastic gloves) in a clean place. All this
            I learnt after joining Urmul. I cut <i>naal</i> (cord) after the <i>anwal </i>(placenta)
            is expelled. I started doing <i>Dai</i> work from the age of 20.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Keshar: We both, Rami and myself are<i>Devrani</i> and <i>Jethani </i>(wives of
            the two brothers, younger and older respectively). We have been handling birth for
            the past 20 years. We keep everything clean, cut the cord. We wait for an hour and
            then <i>boba lagwa dete hain</i> (put the baby to the breast). We feed the woman
            <i>seera </i>(sweet pudding). From our side we try to do everything properly and
            we have been managing well. If the baby is <i>ulta</i> (breech) then we make it
            <i>seedha</i> (head down presentation) and deliver. If baby's legs are down
            then buttock comes out first. If the baby is <i>aara </i>(transverse lie) then we
            make it <i>seedha</i> and deliver it. If the <i>anwal </i>is retained then we massage
            and expel it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Rami Bai. Till now, I may have handled about 100 births. I stay with my <i>Jethani</i>
            and go with her during delivery because now she has become very weak. Now we have
            got training from Urmul so we make the <i>jacha </i>take <i>tika </i>(injection)
            and give <i>goli-tikri</i> (iron tablets and tetanus injection. It is interesting
            to note that women are not referring to specific substances rather the form that
            is given, <i>goli-tikri</i>. We have a concern here that <i>sui</i>-<i>tika </i>
            -<em>goli</em> medicine's are being practiced without understanding the pharmacological
            properties of these medicines). We cut <i>naal</i>. If there is keel (the first
            milk-colostrum) in the <i>bitani</i> (nipple) than we clean it so the milk should
            flow. We spread the <i>mainia</i> (plastic sheet) and do deliveries.

        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Uma: I am 70 and I have been doing <i>Dai</i> work for the past 50 years. I learnt
            <i>Dai</i> work from an old woman who was my neighbor. I learnt by going with her.
            If the baby is <i>ulta</i> then we support the woman&#8217;s buttocks and make the
            baby <i>seedha</i> and deliver. I cut the <i>nala</i> after the baby and the <i>anwal
            </i>are expelled. I still handle deliveries and I am also teaching one or two women
            who are my neighbors. Now I have become weak so I take someone along with me.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Paana: I learnt <i>Dai</i> work in my <i>pihar</i>. I learnt from my mother and
            <i>Mausi</i>. I used to go with them. When I was small, 13-14 years, I went to <i>sasural</i>,
            where my <i>Saas</i> taught me <i>Dai</i>' work. I learnt by going with her.
            I handle <i>aara </i>and <i>ulta</i> births. If the baby is too <i>aara </i>then
            its difficult. I manage to make it little <i>seedha</i>. Before we used to spread
            <i>mitti</i> (sand) and there was no <i>goli-tikri</i>. We used to give <i>karha</i>
            of <i>ajwain</i> and laung (concoction of omum and clove). This hastens delivery.
            We also boil milk, mix <i>ghee</i> (clarified butter) and shakkar (sugar) in it
            and give this to the woman. This produces heat and helps in getting the pains early.
            In villages we get garame ki goli (garame tablets- we are not sure what this is
            it might be brahmi tablets) which is given. We give small cloves. We also rub clove
            and make <i>karha</i> and give.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            I started learning <i>Dai</i> work from the age of 13-14. I had an interest in this
            work since then. Now I am teaching my <i>Bahu</i> (daughter-in-law). For the past
            15-20 years I have been handling deliveries here.<br />
            Kisturi: I live in village Lalavali&#8217;s, 15 SM chak. Earlier, my <i>Saas</i>
            used to handle deliveries. I learnt from her. I have been handling deliveries for
            the past 15-20 years. My <i>Bahu</i> lives with me and I am teaching her. If the
            pains are less intense then we have laung, <i>ajwain</i> or paan garame tablets.
            I do it if I think that I can manage or else I send the woman to the hospital. I
            manage to handle baby in <i>aara </i>, <i>terha</i> positions. First the baby moves
            down slowly, then the pain starts. For instance, the bachedani ka muh (mouth of
            the uterus) has not opened then it will take some time, if it is open then I can
            make out the time of delivery. I can make out because night and day I do this work
            and examine the mouth of uterus.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            I have migrated from a place near <i>Sardar</i> town. I was given land here and
            I have been living here for the past 20-25 years. I started handling deliveries
            from the time I came here. I used to handle delivery of my neighbors, my daughters
            and of my <i>Bahu</i>s because there was no other kind of facility here. Later I
            took training.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Chuki: I am from a village in Churu but now for the past 15-20 years I have been
            living here in Khelasar. My mother was old and used to go for deliveries. She used
            to say that my hands are weak and that I should go with her. And that she would
            teach me how to do it. She used to say that massage like this, aise masal doe, put
            your hands here, do this and do that. I stayed with her for 15-20 years. In my <i>sasural</i>
            there was a Raj <i>Dai</i>. She used to say, give garame goli , do this and do that
            and you will manage it. She used to say that everyday you should not call me, just
            give all this and handle it yourself. After this wherever I went I managed it perfectly.
            If the baby is in <i>aara </i>, <i>terha</i> position then I move the baby with
            my hands and it becomes <i>seedha</i>.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: Who is a <i>Raj Dai</i>?</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Chuki: <i>Raj Dai</i> used to be employed by the government and went to everyone's
            house. She was given 300 rupees. We also gave her around 100-150 rupees. She used
            to come everyday, and also used to teach us, how to bathe the baby and take care
            of the baby and other things. She said, you just sit at home so go out to work.
            In the whole village there was only one <i>Raj Dai</i> and she used to go for deliveries.
            She was given grain and clothes. A bucket full of <em>bajra</em> (millet) and suit
            (dress) was given. I was given land over here so I moved here and neighbors started
            calling me. The work is going fine. Recently a<em> jat</em> (farmer) family called
            me. The baby was not coming out, glucose was given by the nurse but she wrote that
            the baby will die so they should take the woman somewhere else. The woman did some
            heavy work so the<em> bacha phas gaya</em> (baby got stuck in the pelvis). I told
            them that I will not be able to manage. The woman was in lot of pain. If she stays
            with me then maybe I can handle. Till late night I kept her with me. Then I let
            her go home. At 1 p.m. I went to her place and she gave birth at 10 a.m. the next
            day. The nurse gave her glucose, 3 bottles of glucose were given and only after
            that she delivered a baby girl. This is the first case of its kind, otherwise there
            are simple deliveries.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            In a simple case we go and straight away give <i>ajwain</i> , <em>laung </em>ka
            <i>karha</i> and the pains start. I have been doing <i>Dai</i> work for a long time
            but have faced no problem and have managed. If the position of the baby is little
            <i>aara </i>, <i>terha</i> then I <em>masal kar</em> (massage) correct the position.
            Give <i>karha</i> of methi, <i>ajwain</i>, laung (concoction of fenugreek seeds,
            omum and clove). I see the mouth has opened then I know that it's time for
            the baby to come out. Only then I use my hand. In the beginning of the ninth month
            I can see and tell that now there is lot of time for delivery. If the time has come
            then the mouth is opening then I use my hand. If 10-15 days are left then I do not
            put my hands.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kheevni Bai: I learnt <i>Dai</i> work from my mother and <i>Mausi</i> (mother&#8217;s
            sister). If the baby is in <i>ulta</i> position then buttocks come out first. Ghati
            (neck portion) may get stuck and I can take it out. On one woman first I did an
            external examination, touched her belly to check if the baby was moving around and
            felt the pulse of the baby then I did an internal check up of the bachadani. If
            the <em>bachadani rupya aath ana khuli hai</em> (uterus is half open, literal meaning
            half of a rupee, fifty paisa, establishing a co-relation between the break-up of
            aanas in paisa and that of the opening womb) then the baby will take aath or solah
            pahar (8-16 <em>pahar</em>, time, probably one pahar is equivalent to four hours,
            they have their own system of calculating time). If it has opened an inch then the
            baby will come out fast. I do a check up and then give a tablet, <i>karha</i> or
            <i>ajwain</i> or anything that produces heat and helps in the birth. After birth
            I take out the <i>anwal </i>if it is retained. If the baby is not crying then I
            hold the baby up side down and slap its back and abdomen. I sprinkle cold water
            of the earthen pot and the baby starts crying. I bathe and clean the new baby, cut
            the <i>nala</i>. Massage jachas' stomach and also press the woman's perineum
            with my heel. I use to spread <i>mitti</i> and cut the <i>nala</i> with a knife.
            But now I do not use <i>mitti</i>. If the baby is <i>aara </i>(across lie) then
            we have to send the woman to the hospital. If the baby dies or the woman has twins
            then we manage the delivery at home. If the woman is bleeding heavily then we keep
            something under her <em>dunga</em> (buttocks) and elevate her legs. But these days,
            people are aware of this problem so they take the woman directly to the hospital.
            At times, during pregnancy there is too much of water, this I can make out. In such
            cases, as much as 2 pots of water come out.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Guddi: My <i>sasural</i> was very large. My <i>Devrani</i> , <i>Jethani</i> and
            <i>Nanad </i>used to have babies. During this time I used to stay with them and
            watch how <i>Dai</i> used to do <i>ulta</i> into <i>seedha</i>. And I learned by
            watching her. I used to watch the senior <i>Dai</i>, who used to make the breech
            baby move to a head down position and could also deliver dead babies. She used to
            give milk, <i>ghee</i> and <em>ajwain ka karha </em>and handled birth so well. She
            used to support the woman.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            I have been doing <i>Dai</i> work for the past 20 years. I learnt it from my Dadi
            <i>Saas</i> (husband&#8217;s paternal grand mother). She was a very well known <i>Dai</i>.
            Till now I have not spoiled any delivery. I manage to change the position of <i>aara
            </i>-<i>terha</i> baby. I can also estimate the time of the delivery. If the pains
            are not coming then I boil milk and scraped kopra (coconut) and give it to the woman
            to drink. Within 10 minutes the baby is delivered.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Manohari: I have been working as a <i>Dai</i> in my village Raner for the past 20-25
            years. My <i>Saas</i> used to do <i>Dai</i> work. I used to accompany my <i>Saas</i>.
            I learnt everything from my <i>Saas</i> .I learnt to handle <i>aara </i>, <i>munda</i>,
            and <i>ulta</i> baby. After my <i>Saas</i>'s death I started working on my
            own. If the baby is totally <i>aara </i>than I cannot manage it. If it is little
            <i>aara </i>and <i>munda</i> and the baby's legs are down, I manage on my own.
            If the pains are mild then I do not give anything. I see how far the baby has come
            down. If only 4 fingers distance is left (she seems not to be measuring the width
            of the cervix but descent of the baby in the pelvic from outside) then I give one
            <i>tikki</i> (a tablet made of ayurvedic herb) and the baby is delivered. If at
            this stage there is less pains (contractions) then I boil milk and put <i>ghee</i>,
            <em>shakkar, laung and ajwain</em> and give the <i>karha</i>. This increases the
            strength of the pain. I carefully check the bachadani to determine how much it has
            opened. If it has dilated to three fingers, then I deliver the baby. Before we used
            to make the woman lie down on <i>dhool</i>-<i>mitti</i> and cut the <i>naal</i>
            (cord) with the blade. The baby was given mother's milk (<em>bache ko chubhate</em>)
            under the coolness of the stars. Eight drops of milk is given initially. If the
            birth takes place in the morning then the milk is given in the evening after the
            stars come out. Till then both mother and child keep lying on the sand. Now so many
            things are given, <i>mainia</i> (plastic sheet to spread) and<em> plastic ke haanth</em>
            (gloves). Before we had no such things. We used to directly put our hands in the
            bachadani. A woman used to be left on the sand for 3-4 days. Now I am teaching my
            <i>Bahu</i> (daughter-in-law). Before, for 5-7-9 days we used to not take the baby
            out nor put any clothes on the baby. From my side I do good work.<br />
            Rukma: I learnt <i>Dai</i> work from my mother and <em>Dadi</em> (paternal grandmother).
            First she taught me to do a checkup. Once I learnt that then she taught me to handle
            birth. I can make out whether the baby is <i>aara </i>or <i>ulta</i> or <i>munda</i>
            in the <em>kothali </em>(bag). I give a hot <i>karha</i> made out of laung and jayphal
            (clove and nutmeg). If the<em> <i>shareer</i> </em>(uterus) is coming out then I
            support the perineum and help deliver the baby. If the <i>shareer</i> comes out
            post delivery then slowly with our heel we put it in. We do this for three days.
            I have been working like this for the past 20 years. Before we used to cut the <i>naal</i>
            with the knife. If woman felt cold then I used to heat up <i>mitti</i> and made
            her lie on it. In 6th month by feeling the woman's belly, I can make out that
            she is carrying twins. You can make out once they start moving.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Prema: I was married at the age of 15-16 years. When I was 18-19 years I learnt
            <i>Dai</i> work. I stayed with my mother. My mother did <i>Dai</i> work and she
            took me along with her and used to say that I should learn <i>Dai</i> work. Before
            we used to give <i>karha</i>. Mix <i>ajwain</i>, <em>methi</em>(fenugreek seeds)<em>
                laung</em> (clove)and <em>gur </em>(jaggery) in the boiling milk. And this used
            to increase the pain. After the delivery we used to cut the <em>nara</em> (umbilical
            cord) with the knife, spread sand and do deliveries. Earlier the deliveries were
            simple but now it has become very difficult. The body has become very weak because
            of the excessive intake of tea these days. From training, we have learnt about cleanliness
            and that if there is a problem then we show the woman to a doctor. If the water
            bag breaks before time then we show the woman to a doctor.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Jamana: I have been doing <i>Dai</i> work for the past 25 years. If the baby is
            in <i>ulta</i> position then I make it <i>seedha</i> and deliver and cut the <i>naal</i>
            with the knife. I cut it after the <i>anwal </i>is expelled. If the <i>anwal </i>
            is retained then I put the woman&#8217;s hair in her mouth. If the baby does not
            cry then I heat up <i>anwal </i>and slap baby&#8217;s legs, blow in baby&#8217;s
            ears and slap the back of the baby.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Jhinkar: I have been doing <i>Dai</i> work for the past 7 years. I learnt it from
            my <i>Mausi</i>. In my village there was no facility for childbirth so I started
            handling deliveries of my neighbors and of my relatives. I use to do external examination
            of the belly. Before I used to cut the <i>naal</i> with a knife and tie it by using
            the thread of the <em>gudari </em>(a thick bed sheet made out of old clothes). My
            mother or <i>Saas</i> were not <i>Dai</i>.</p>

            Sayar: Nobody is a <i>Dai</i> in my family. I am from a Jat caste. My <em>Dadi Saas</em>
            (husbands' paternal grandmother) was famous for taking out the retained placenta.
            She not only handled births but was also called if the placenta was retained. In
            the village there was only one <i>Dai</i>. I have a large family, <i>Devrani</i>
            , <i>Jethani</i>, <em>Nanade</em> and they used to have babies. During their deliveries
            I used to support them and watch the <i>Dai</i> handle deliveries. I learnt by watching.
            I can make out whether the birth is going to take 3 hours or 4 hours or if the pains
            have increased. First <i>ajwain</i> <i>karha</i> is given, milk, <i>ghee</i> is
            given. If the water bag breaks early then I get a little scared but still I manage
            it. I cut the <i>naal</i> after the <i>anwal </i>falls out. I press the abdomen
            and the <i>anwal </i>is expelled. I have handled many deliveries alone. Here I have
            been doing <i>Dai</i> work for the past 15 years.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Mohini: In my family nobody has done <i>Dai</i> work, my mother or my <em>Nani </em>
            (maternal grandmother). I learnt from Kamala, a nurse. I stayed with her for 5 years.
            Then I was 25 years, my husband had died. The nurse gave me some money for my work.
            I serve the entire village, for stomachache or headache. For delivery everyone comes
            to me.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: Is there a difference in the nurse&#8217;s and the <i>Dai</i>'s way
            of handling delivery?</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Mohini: There is not much difference. I first examine the <em>bachadani</em>. If
            it has dilated then I give heat producing food. If it has not dilated then I go
            home but tell the woman to be careful. I do not spread <i>mitti</i> for delivery.
            When I went with the nurse at that time too we did not spread <i>mitti</i> .</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Bhagwan Kaur: A Muslim <i>Dai</i> lived next door. I learnt from her. Then I started
            doing deliveries on my own. I started at the age of 20. I have delivered triplets.
            The Muslim <i>Dai</i> taught me how to use hands. Muslim <i>Dai</i> are very knowledgeable,
            and this <i>Dai</i> taught me very nicely. I can take out a retained <i>anwal </i>
            , if the pains are not intense then I boil coconut and <i>ajwain</i> in the milk
            and give. If there is a need of <i>sui</i>, <i>tika </i>then I make the woman have
            them. I have delivered many <i>ulta</i> babies. Doctor gives <i>tika </i>, I don&#8217;t
            give.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: You have told us about your work. Few things we could understand but certain
            things were not clear. Now you show us (through role play) how you do deliveries.
            One of you can be a <i>Dai</i> and one can be a <i>jacha </i>(the pregnant woman)
            and one can do a role of the woman who gives support.</p>

            Savitri: Plays the role of a neighbor.</p>

            Role play begins.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            <i>Dai</i>: Examines the belly by touching.&quot; It will take sometime, warm up
            some sand and spreads it&quot;. She gives some hot drink to the woman. The pain
            starts and woman starts crying in pain. <i>Dai</i> supports the woman with her leg
            in sitting position, puts her own legs on the inside portion of the woman&#8217;s
            thighs and the birth takes place.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            <i>Dai</i>: If I am alone then I either make the woman lie down or sit.
            <br />
            After birth the <i>Dai</i> makes the woman lie down and her legs are crossed, one
            leg is put on the other leg.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            <i>Dai</i>: Her legs are crossed so that hawa (air or external energy) does not
            enter her body. Food is given to the new mother.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            <i>Dai</i>: First some gur (jaggery) and <em>anaaj </em>( food grains) is put in
            the plate. <em>Bhagwaan sahi salamat se chutkara dilwana</em> (Bhagwan everything
            should happen smoothly and should be over). Jaggery and grain is divided in two
            portions. With one portion <em>halwa </em>(sweet pudding with lots of <i>ghee</i>)
            is made and new mother eats and the other portion is put in the sieve and 7 times
            it is circulated around the <em>jachas'</em> (woman's) head and <i>Baimata</i>
            is asked to take care.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            <i>Dai</i>: For a month, <i>Dai</i> takes care of the woman. <em>Jachas'</em>
            mother or <i>Saas</i> stays with her. After delivery, for about 3 hours we take
            care of the <i>jacha </i>, sometimes it may take 12 hours. I tie the <em>gola</em>
            ( some form of energy, the abdomen is tied so that the <em>gola </em>gets pressed).
            By tying, gola will get pressed. And this is more difficult then handling a delivery.
            If there is lot of pain then in <em>lota </em>(small metal pot) I put pieces of
            warm bricks, place a piece of cloth on the abdomen and do hot fomentation of the
            <em>gola</em>. Earlier, hot <em>sira</em> (sweet pudding with lots of <i>ghee</i>)
            was also given this would help lessen the <em>gola</em>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            <i>Dai</i>: Gur ka sira,<em> dalia</em> (porridge) is given after childbirth. If
            the <i>jacha </i>desires, little <em>dal</em> (lentil) and one roti is given. We
            take care of the <i>jacha </i>very well. In the ninth month we see <i>jacha </i>
            after every 4 or 5 day. After birth we clean up, bathe the <i>jacha </i>, beat the
            thali (plate) and go home. For 5 days we go to <i>jacha </i>&#8217;s house everyday.
            Put <i>ghee</i> in her hair. Put oil and rajgarh (some herb) in hot water and bathe
            her. This cleans her and will save her from falling ill. If the <i>naal</i> of the
            baby gets infected, pus is formed, then we put warm mustard oil. It clears up.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            We massage the woman&#8217;s body. Add pepper in <i>ghee</i> and massage her head.
            By this <i>jacha </i>will not get headache and will not fall ill. Her head will
            stay cool, pepper helps from getting headache.</p>

            <strong><u>Discussion on Training</u></strong></p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: You have done training so tell us what you learnt from the training? What
            is useful in your work and what is not useful? Tell us openly, if you think that
            something is not correct in the training, you can say about that also.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kheevni: There is a difference in what we did before and what we are doing now.
            Before there were no iron tablets or TT <i>tika </i>(tetanus injection) nor was
            there so much stress laid on cleanliness or not much attention was given to <i>jacha
            </i>during the 9 months. Now we know how green vegetables are very good. That similar
            food should be given to both the daughters and the <i>Bahu</i>s. That nutritious
            food should be given to <i>jacha </i>during pregnancy. About all this we tell everyone
            in the village.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Doctors tell us that we should cut the <i>nala</i> once the baby is expelled. We
            do not like this, it does not <i>sui</i>t us. We are not convinced and have no faith
            in it. Doctors have a remedy but we do not have. Doctors say that <i>anwal </i>does
            not climb up in the chest but we do not believe. If the <i>anwal </i>is not expelled
            then the family will curse us so we do not cut the <i>nala</i>.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Paana: People will say (sarcastically) that well, she is a trained <i>Dai</i>. So
            even if the child is lying in cold or on sand we do not cut the <i>nala</i>. Once
            I had cut the <i>nala</i> early then both <i>jacha </i>and bacha (baby) died, I
            got very scared. Village people abused me. That was some other <i>Dai’s</i> case.
            Because of that experience, now I do not cut the <i>nala</i> till the <i>anwal </i>
            is out.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Doctors say that in case you have to take the woman to the hospital then how can
            you bring her with the child hanging. But we are not convinced.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Uma: A girl had a bacha and the <i>nala</i> was cut and the bacha was separated.
            But the <i>anwal </i>was still inside. I went and took it out. I was very afraid
            the whole day and kept thinking why the <i>nala</i> was cut. Anyway I managed it
            well. With folded hands I prayed to Bhagwan and <i>anwal </i>came out. I never cut
            the <i>nala</i> till the <i>anwal </i>is expelled.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Rukma: I learnt <i>Dai</i> work by being with my mother. My mother was a traditional
            <i>Dai</i>. When I was small I used to go with my mother. I used to watch her, how
            she used to do <i>japa</i>. When I learnt <i>Dai</i> work I was 20 years old. I
            used to give <em>jayphal</em> (nutmeg) garame ki goli and <i>ajwain</i> ka <i>karha</i>.
            According to our traditional practice we used to do this. I have never sent anyone
            to hospital.<br />
            These days if the <i>japa</i> seems to be difficult and I feel that I will not be
            able to handle it then I send the woman to the hospital. But till now I have not
            spoilt any case. In 100 cases may be, I send one case to the hospital. We do not
            even have a doctor in our village.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Jarau: I lost my parents when I was small. We are 3 brothers and sisters. I asked
            the <em>Raj</em> <i>Dai</i> to teach me <i>Dai</i> work. I learnt it by being with
            Raj <i>Dai</i>. She took me the first day. She told me everything. She taught me
            about <i>aara </i>,<i>terha</i> . We used to do <em>gharelu ilaaj</em> (home treatment).
            We can accomplish our work by giving <em>garame ki goli,</em> <em>jaiphal </em>etc.
            Before I used to spread sand but after training we have stopped. In the village
            people call us day and night, for <i>japa</i>. I do everything, cut the <i>naal</i>
            also. I can tell at what time the birth is going to happen.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: Matrika is trying to understand, recognize and advocate <i>Dai</i>'
            work. Matrika will tell city and town people and other such organizations, that
            <i>Dai</i> has the skill and is as competent as a doctor. People think that <i>Dai</i>
            can handle only simple deliveries but we know that there have been difficult occasions
            where a <i>Dai</i> has managed well. <i>Dai</i> handles more births than doctors
            and go to small villages and cater to poor people also. People also do not have
            the money to give doctors fees. The most important thing is that <i>Dai</i> gives
            and does <i>japa</i> with love, affection and care. She knows the <i>jacha </i>and
            has a special relationship with her.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            <i>Dai</i> have a special relationship with the woman. You have a deeper knowledge
            of her body and therefore have a special relationship with her. We saw in the Role
            Play that the woman hides her face from her <i>Saas</i> but opens her <i>shareer</i>
            for the <i>Dai</i>.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kheevni: <i>Dai</i> <em>aur Mai </em>( <i>Dai</i> and mother) are the same that
            is what we say here. Mai comes later but <i>Dai</i> reaches before her. <i>Dai</i>
            is like <em>Bhagwan</em>. <i>jacha </i>herself has to run to see a doctor but <i>Dai</i>
            goes and sees the <i>jacha </i>, takes care and asks her if she has a problem (Implying
            that <i>Dai</i> is available like Bhagwan whereas doctors are far removed). A <i>Dai</i>
            can also tell the time of delivery.</p>

            <strong><u>Film Show </u></strong>
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Everyone watched the film on the two Rajasthani <i>Dai</i>, Chhoti Devi and Dhapo
            of Jehangirpuri, Delhi. Some watched very intently, they were nodding their head
            maybe in agreement with whatever the two <i>Dai</i> were saying. However a few lost
            interest perhaps the film was too long or maybe they were tired and hungry or maybe
            they could not relate to the film as a medium.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            After the film, a number of <i>Dai</i> were still in the room when <em>Satyanarayan</em>
            came in and asked them to honestly speak about any problems they have. <i>Dai</i>
            immediately started speaking very animatedly about problems they face in using <i>mainia</i>(plastic
            sheets) for deliveries. <em>Jarau</em> said they are each given only one sheet so
            she has had to tear her sheet into six pieces. Other <i>Dai</i> also angrily said
            that the <em>khoon-tatti-pishab</em> (blood, excreta and urine) stay on a plastic
            sheet whereas if sand is used, all this gets soaked in.

            From Matrika: Renuka</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kisturi: If a pregnant woman comes to us then we ask her to eat well. We tell her
            to eat all the things that she feels like having. If it's not available at
            home or if she cannot afford it then she should ask her neighbors. Whatever she
            likes she should eat, be it made at home or be it from the <em>bazaar</em>. If she
            does not like her <em>roti</em> then she could ask for <em>sabji</em> (vegetables)
            from others, <i>Dai</i> gives the permission or encouragement to do so. By third
            month we ask her to have <i>ghee</i>, water melon and cucumber etc. We ask her to
            <em>pagan</em>(walk) to her work but in the eighth month we ask the woman not to
            carry heavy things. Because if naar <em>chanak gayi</em> (veins are pulled),the
            fetus moves down then it can give problems to the woman. If the fetus shifts to
            the <em>nabhi</em> (navel) then there is lot of pain (perhaps carrying of heavy
            weight puts woman's body out of balance. The pulse that is supposed to be at
            woman's navel is displaced and gives pain). In eighth month woman has to be
            very careful. If the fetus stops moving around then woman is made to lie down and
            her legs are lifted and shaken. By this the fetus comes back to normal position.
            The pains stop.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Eighth month is very dangerous. If the fetus is delivered in eighth month then it
            does not survive because<em> aath kaath hota hai</em> (eight is like dried up wood).
            <em>Kaath</em> means wood and wood burns out and is finished likewise eighth month
            baby does not survive (baby is in the process of getting a proper form and therefore
            this stage is dangerous). If the fetus crosses two or three days of the ninth month,
            it survives. But very few deliveries happen in the eighth month because we take
            lot of care. If it is hot summer then we do not allow the woman to work in sun.
            Ask her to have cooling food. In winter we ask her to wear lot of clothes. Ask her
            to have hot food and ask her not to lift heavy stuff.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            In eighth month we do not let the woman move between her <em>peehar</em> (mothers'
            house) and <i>sasural</i>(husbands' house) as something may happen on the way.
            Moreover, <em>aath kaath hota hai</em>. We do not let her roam around or step on
            wood or perhaps climb trees (it is interesting to note that traditionally any serious
            traveling would be on the wooden carts pulled by some animal) therefore she is not
            allowed to go anywhere.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            When it is time for the delivery then the woman calls us. If delivery is not to
            happen at that time then we tell her and emotionally support her. We keep a watch
            and tell her that it will take another two, three or four days. We ask her to take
            rest.</p>

            Kheevni: If the pains are <em>ruk ruk kar dheere dheere</em> (at intervals and are
            mild) then it is<em> kachha dard</em> (false pain). If it is pakka dard then we
            with our fingers can make out how much the mouth of the uterus (<em>garbhashay ka muh</em>)
            has opened. Second, we can see the belly and assess. In pakka dard the belly is
            firm and the baby stops moving. If the pains are little less than we give <i>ajwain</i>
            gur ka <i>karha</i>(concoction of omum and jaggery),the pain gets increased. The
            pains are long and recurrent. Then the pains are at three-four minutes interval.
            Then by three long pains of five minutes each the baby is delivered.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            When the<em> pakka dard</em> starts coming then the top of the abdomen has a four
            finger empty space and the fetus is low in the birth canal. At <em>pakka dard </em>
            the woman starts sweating, she is hot and says that now I am going to die I will
            not survive. She starts calling her mother and father then we give her reassurance.
            We tell her that it happens to everyone, it happened to that woman and to that woman.
            I take names of familiar women and say that for her <em><i>japa</i></em> I was there
            and for another woman's <em><i>japa</i></em> also I was there. Everyone gets
            these pains, I also got pain. We tell her that she should just tolerate the pain
            for a while and the <em>tabar</em>(baby) is about to be delivered. Here comes the
            <em>tabar</em>, here it comes. We keep saying this. We massage her and stroke her.
            (with these words the <i>Dai</i> gives her hope of the presence of the other women,
            <i>Dai</i> is making herself the conduit, encouraging and admonishing her to patience
            and tolerance, giving her psychological support).</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Many times the woman's body does not open fully. Then we put our hand and with
            our fingers we can make out. We put oil in our fingers and stretch the flesh. This
            helps in letting the head come out easily. With mustard oil we massage the vagina
            very softly. When we feel that the mouth has opened then we stop. We don't
            do it many times. More than twice we do not even do an internal check up. If the
            pains are mild then in<em> ajwain gur ka karha</em> we put <i>ghee</i> and give.
            The pain increases by the<em> ghee ki chiknai</em> (fat of the <i>ghee</i> which
            acts as a lubricant) the baby comes down. The pain is increased by gur and <i>ajwain</i>
            because it produces heat.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Maybe the pains are not coming because of some <em>aanth</em> (blockage) inside
            then to open that block we open all the knots. We take off woman's <i>bindi</i>(red
            mark on the forehead) bangles, hair band( these social things perhaps create blockage),
            locks on boxes and windows. We say <em><i>Baimata</i></em> open her knots the way
            we opened all knots. We also give alms. Wheat grains are circulated around <em>jachas'</em>
            head, and are given to pigeons. Wheat grains, jaggery or flour is taken and divided
            in two portions. The larger portion is for the expectant mother and the smaller
            one for the baby. And with folded hands we say, &quot;<i>Baimata kasht khatam karo</i>&quot;
            (relieve her from suffering). And then we offer these things in alms or give it
            to the birds.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            There is a separate room for <i>japa</i>(delivery). At the time of <i>japa</i> the
            <i>Dai</i> remembers all her Devi-Devata (Goddesses and Gods). With folded hands
            pay obeisance to <i>Baimata</i> and <em>Dharti Mata</em> (Mother Earth). Before
            entering the room in which the woman is sleeping (<i>japa</i> ghar), we touch its
            threshold and pay obeisance, the way we do to the threshold of a temple(making an
            analogy, <i>japa</i>-ghar is like a temple and the laboring woman is like the idol
            in the temple. The feelings for the laboring woman is similar to that what is for
            the idol). We fold our hands and say,&quot; Bhagwan do justice and relieve her from
            agony&quot;.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            When a <i>Dai</i> goes for <i>japa</i>, first she goes near the fire. By this she
            wards off the evil spirit and the infection and then only goes to the <i>jacha </i>
            . If <i>Dai</i> is coming from outside, then she waits outside for five-ten minutes.
            She dusts off her clothes and believes that the spell of any animal, dog or cat
            or that of an <i>atma or chaya </i>(spirit) or buri <i>nazar</i> (evil eye) will
            be warded off. And the <i>jacha </i>will not have any problem. The people at home
            are told to keep a pot of water and a knife near her head so that no <i>bhooth-pret
            </i>(evil spirit) comes. In siyale(winter) a coal or charcoal brazier(angitih) is
            also kept. We believe evil spirit cannot come near fire, water and iron. There is
            a fear that <i>Bhutni</i>(female demon) may come attracted by the aroma of <i>ajwain</i>.
            <i>Bhutni</i> is a dissatisfied spirit, who died early and therefore wanders around.
            She has a desire for everything therefore she may come by <i>ajwain</i>'s aroma.
            <i>Bhutni</i> is also attracted by the foul smell of <i>gandh</i> (dirt, perhaps
            it is considered as dirt because if it stays inside then it becomes poisonous) and
            in those days there is smell from dirty blood and therefore she may come. <i>Bhutni</i>
            is alone, so she feels that if somebody dies then she will get company and will
            feel good (<i>Bhutni</i>'s need of company is similar to the mother's
            need of companionship). Therefore she wanders around the expectant mother. We too
            feel nice if there are four people with us similarly <i>Bhutni</i> feels she should
            have more people for company. There is a custom here that the <i>jacha </i>is not
            left alone till she has had a bath, name is given for the baby and the puja is done.
            <i>Dai</i> sleeps in her room or somebody from the new mother's house, may
            be, mother or sister or <i>Devrani</i> or <i>Jethani</i>.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kheevni: If the <i>jacha </i>gets tired during birth then we support her belly.
            This gives her a little support. If the <em>pani ka thaili</em>(bag of water )breaks
            or <em>desu dhal gaya</em> (the breaking of water bag is referred as desu dhal gaya)
            then delivery should happen within half an hour otherwise the water may enter into
            baby's eyes, nose, mouth or the veins and this can be dangerous for the baby.
            After desu dhalna the head can be seen. We ask the woman to apply force to hasten
            delivery. If she gets tired then we hold her belly and her legs and help her to
            push. She is also reassured by this act as she feels that somebody is supporting
            her. If the head is stuck in the birth canal for a longer time then it gets elongated.
            After birth of the baby we massage her belly by stroking in circles and slowly,
            take out the placenta. After this we clean baby's mouth and ears. And cut and
            tie the cord at four fingers.<br />
            Then we take care( <em>saaj-sambhal</em>)of the woman. We put <i>ghee</i> and press
            her forehead. Then we make the woman stand and the <i>Dai</i> presses the <i>jacha </i>
            's belly with her head to help expel blood. This is kala khoon(black blood).
            In this way the nine months stored blood is expelled. This flattens the belly. If
            the blood is not taken out then the belly looks swollen as if there is a baby inside.
            If this is not done, then the bleeding continues for a month or month and half.
            If the kala khoon is taken out then bleeding stops in three-four days.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            There is a separate room for <i>japa</i>. Only <i>jacha </i>, <i>Dai</i> and another
            woman who takes care of woman, may be the <i>Saas</i> or anybody else, stay there.
            For <i>jacha </i>there is separate utensil, a plate, a glass is kept. These utensils
            are considered unclean. If someone touches them then he/she has to bathe. Till the
            <i>jacha </i>has a bath, name is given to the baby and puja is done she is considered
            unclean (<i>chhutak</i>). No outsider can go inside. <i>jacha </i>'s uncleanness
            is contagious but not that of <i>Dai</i> because she goes out, and also has a bath.
            On fortieth day the earthen pots are changed (an analogy between the earthen pots
            and the woman). After bathing the new mother, the room is also cleaned. Till this
            day only <i>Dai</i> was touching her and taking care of her. Nobody from the house
            was touching the <i>jacha </i>. <i>Dai</i> massages the new mother and the new baby.
            There is tradition to use wheat grain flour, <i>ghee</i> and turmeric for massage.
            This softens <em>jachas'</em> skin and her skin glows like that of a new bride.
            Her <i>shareer</i> is cleaned with warm water and <i>Rangjhar</i>(some herb) water.
            <i>Rangjhar</i> is like the roots of <i>baer</i>(berries). We boil <i>Rangjhar</i>
            and put <i>ghee</i> in this water and make the new mother sit in it. This helps
            in fomentation and prevents infection. This is done for three-four days. If the
            woman gets a perineum tear then we soak cotton in <i>ghee</i> and turmeric and keep
            it on the tear for three-four days.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Ramratni: In <i>Marwari </i>language, <i>shareer</i> is called <i>Bhosari </i>or
            <em>Chooth</em> or tita or <em>china</em> These words are used only for <em>gaali</em>(abuse).
            At the time of <i>japa</i> or if there is some disease then the word <i>shareer</i>
            is used. Like if there is a problem of <em>safed pani </em>(white discharge) then
            it is said <em>shareer se safed pani nikal raha hai or shareer main khujali ho rahi
                hai</em> ( vagina is itching).</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kheevni: If the head gets stuck in the <i>shareer</i>(birth canal) then we put oil
            and stretch the <i>shareer</i> and slowly with our fingers, pull the body of the
            child and take it out. If the baby is <i>terha</i>(not in favorable position) then
            an operation is to be done in the hospital(<i>Dai</i> recognizes the problem). A
            baby with crossed feet (<em>aalti- palti</em>) does not open even with massage.
            We do an internal examination and if the mouth of the uterus is not open and it
            seems that it would be difficult then we send the woman to the hospital.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Rami: Baby with folded hands and legs, twins and babies like monkey or lions'
            shape (monster baby) are very difficult deliveries. Sometimes the child takes the
            form of monkey or lion but these happen in one in thousand cases. But I have delivered
            such baby's. <i>Dai</i> are respected by people if they manage such difficult
            cases.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kheevni: If a <i>Dai</i> spoils a case then that family does not let the <i>Dai</i>
            enter their house and don't give her anything. They trouble her a lot. But
            if a doctor spoils a case then nothing is said.<br />
            Kisturi: Otherwise also <i>Dai</i> take so much care, doctor doesn't, but families
            give nothing to the <i>Dai</i>. Doctor is not concerned about the woman being dead
            or alive only scolds. <i>Dai</i> massages woman's hand and feet and works so
            much but people don't give her anything. We only want to earn for our two-
            time bread but we get nothing.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            By the birth of a girl baby woman has many problems. Many times the <i>Dai</i> does
            not tell the woman immediately after birth that she has got a girl baby. <i>Dai</i>
            takes everything on herself. On the birth of girl even lesser money is given. <i>Dai</i>
            does not have fixed homes to go to for work. Anyone can call her. She can go to
            anyone's house.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kisturi: <i>Dai</i> is also deceived many times. Some men of families see that the
            <i>Dai</i> is a little weak then they misbehave with her. <i>Dai</i> goes out to
            earn a little money and men try to abuse her. Many time men in jachas' family
            are drunk and they say bad things. It's quiet unsafe when men come to call
            us and take us. Therefore we do not go to far off villages. We go in our own village
            or to known people's houses. We never go alone but with other two- three neighboring
            women.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Bhagwan Kaur: Once in some village a man asked the nurse to come to his house for
            delivery. In the house they had dressed up a woman like a man and had also made
            him look pregnant. The nurse went in to help but was abused. Likewise <i>Dai</i>
            have also been mistreated.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kheevni: At birth it has been a tradition to spread <i>mitti</i> but for the past
            2-3 years we are being told to spread <i>mainia</i>(plastic sheet). Urmul has been
            saying this. Women dislike <i>mainia</i> because the dirty blood collects on it
            and the woman can see it. Some even use the same <i>mainia</i> for the delivery
            of another woman and women do not like it. <i>Dai</i> also say that we have conducted
            ten deliveries, seven deliveries on <i>mitti</i> nothing happened so why should
            we use <i>mainia</i>. <i>mitti</i> soaks, all the dirt, a sheet can be spread on
            <i>mitti</i> still it soaks all the dirt. If a woman does not see that black dirty
            blood then she does not get a shock.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kisturi: Doctors and the western medicine people say that with <i>mitti</i> infection
            may enter her body and can lead to white discharge disease or other problems. Many
            women have white discharge problem. Now people believe that many infections are
            caused because of <i>mitti</i>.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kheevni: Before women used to get healthy food like <em>khichari </em>(a mixture
            of cooked rice and lentils) <em>rabari</em>(thickened milk) <em>chaach</em>(thickened
            milk) and other cooling food, milk and curd and these were very healthy foods. Grains
            were grown without fertilizers and had pure water from deep inside the earth. These
            days we get dirty water of canal to drink, and fertilizer food to eat. This gives
            illness to women. We are not in favor of using <i>mitti</i> but the older women
            in the family force us to use it.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kisturi: <i>mitti</i> gives <em>garmaas</em> (heat) and helps in getting pains early
            and facilitates birth. Many times in <em>kacha dard</em> woman is made to lie on
            <i>mitti</i> . Woman feels relaxed. Besides generally if a woman gets a backache
            then too she sleeps on the <i>mitti </i>, she feels nice.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Santosh: <i>mitti </i>of this region is very clean and good. <i>mitti </i>is brought

            Ramratni: In our area <i>mitti </i>under the <em>aank</em> (herb) tree is used and
            it is very clean. People do not shit near that tree. Medicinal value of the <em>aank</em>
            tree is also in that <i>mitti </i>.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kisturi: There are also certain disease's that can be stopped by this <i>mitti

            <i>Dai</i> Mai(<i>Dai</i> mother) can help in birth but fate is written by <i>Baimata</i>.
            Till birth, life depends on <i>Dai</i>. We count the months of pregnancy on the
            basis of moon(waxing waning). Like if her periods stop on <em>amavasya</em> (no
            moon) then on next <em>amavasya</em> it will be one month.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Chuki: Earlier no cloth was spread on <i>mitti </i>. But now we spread a sheet on
            <i>mitti </i>. Before we used to conduct <i>japa</i> on earth floor and then the
            baby was taken aside and the new mother was made to lie on the <i>mitti </i>.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            If the woman gets nervous then we do <i>japa</i> in squatting position and support
            her from behind. If <em>bacha peeche hota hai</em> (the pressure is towards the
            woman&#8217;s back, the rectum) then we put cloth in the <em>latrin ka rasta</em>
            (anus) and press it with our hands so that it does not get on the baby's head
            or chest and the baby is not stuck in that passage. If woman is anemic then her
            body becomes pale and swells up and she goes blind when she stands up. If woman's
            legs have swelling then with warm salted water fomentation is done and this restarts
            circulation of blood.</p>

            Rami: If a woman is anemic then we massage her with salt water and ask her to eat
            well like to have milk, curd, green vegetables, green gram, spinach, lentils, watermelon
            and <em>tinda</em>( a vegetable).If there is nothing at home then she gets <em>chhaachh</em>(thinned
            curd) from the neighbors. We ask her to have lot of <em>khichri</em>(cooked mixture

            - thirty six, we are trying to understand if the term nari is being used for veins,
            meridian or vessels). Therefore it is considered bad to cut <i>naal</i> and <em>Rajput</em>
            and <em>Brahmins</em> (upper castes) do not cut the <i>naal</i> (cord). Only <em>Megh</em>
            and <em>Nayak</em> (lower caste) <i>Dai</i> cut <i>naal</i> or the new mother herself

            should be educated. These days children have started studying. There is lot of water
            problem.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Kheevni: From winter till spring we dry up vegetables like <em>tindasi kakari </em>
            and eat it throughout the year. But because of water shortage there are many problems
            these days. Vegetables cannot be grown. Wherever there is canal, agriculture can
            be done, vegetables also grow there. Crops fail because of shortage of water. People
            who have some facility do agriculture. Our men work in <em>jats'</em> land.
            They do some small work. Our life is very difficult. We go to far off places to
            bring water. Before we had drying variety of vegetables and leafy vegetables and
            our own produce would last for a year. But now we have to buy vegetables.</p>

            From Matrika: Deepti.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: Tell us about the things that you do at the time of birth?</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Mohini: We examine woman's <em>paet</em> (belly). If twins are there then both
            the sides of the <em>paet</em> is hard as there is a baby on each side and it is
            soft in the center. We can make out that twins are there. We can make out by seventh
            -eighth month. If one baby is in a head down position then its head comes first
            and if the other baby is <i>ulta</i> then buttock comes out first and then hands
            and legs come out. Twins have one <i>anwal </i>. This can be dangerous for the twins.
            Sometimes there are 2 anwals, one for each baby, then there is no danger of them
            falling ill. Twins with one <i>anwal </i>may have problems even in later years.
            If one falls ill then the other also falls ill. The fear of illness and death is
            there. At the time of birth <i>ajwain</i>, <em>brahami ki goli </em>and <em>laung</em>
            is given. The pain starts 15 days early. At the time of delivery the <em>pindi</em>(upper
            back of the thighs) is massaged. It is massaged the way the <i>jacha </i>asks for.
            The woman's legs start shaking, she has pains in her <em>Kamar</em>(whole of
            lower back and waist area) <em>shareer ubaharta hai</em> (at the time of birth mother's
            body is coming to its fullness-baby's head fills the vagina), the baby starts
            coming out. Head starts showing and at that time we start using our hands to help.
            <em>Pairwa</em> (water) keeps on flowing.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Paana: If the woman is vomiting then we believe it <em>uparla desu</em>(energy associated
            with desu goes up).<em>Desu</em> (bag of water) comes down. She passes stool many
            times. When desu breaks then water comes out like a fountain. Baby is in the <em>thaili</em>(
            bag of water). If <em>thaili</em> comes out then we break the thaili. Baby comes
            out with the <em>jhilli</em>, (membrane).</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Keshar Bai: A thick piece of cloth is placed against the <em>tatti wala rasta</em>
            (anus). We make the woman squat on the bricks and press the cloth against the anus.
            So that the baby is delivered smoothly. By this the baby does not go towards the
            back. And even she exerts pressure towards the front. The baby then comes out fast.
            We hold her <em>paet</em> and straighten the <i>anwal </i>and take it out. The cord
            should not be pulled hard.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Prema: We wait for half an hour for the <i>anwal </i>to come out. Then we have to
            take it out. We do not cut the <i>naal</i> till the placenta is delivered. We believe
            in case of girl baby the <i>anwal </i>takes longer to come out. We do not tell the
            <i>jacha </i>the sex of the child till the <i>anwal </i>is delivered.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Paana: If <i>jacha </i>' s <em>bacha</em> dies at birth then the <i>Dai</i>
            puts the next baby born to this woman in a <em>chhanle</em>(sieve). Puts 1 kg of
            salt in mother's <em>jholi</em> (the woman holds out her saree to receive).
            <i>Dai</i> says &quot;<em>bacha le lo bacha le lo</em>&quot;(take the baby, take
            the baby). Then mother takes the baby in exchange of salt. Then that baby lives.
            Then the baby's nose and ears are pierced. The place the baby's head touched
            at the time of birth --a coconut is buried there. An earthen pot is broken and the
            baby is passed through the mouth of the pot.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Mohini: The mouth of the pot is tied on the top of the hut. <i>tikki</i> (the red
            sticker, sindoor which is put on the forehead by women), baal, laung, churi (hair,
            nose ring and bangles) are taken off and offered to <i>Baimata</i>. After the birth
            of the baby a Chhati Puja is done, at that time the <i>jacha </i>is made to wear
            all the things (bangles and <i>tikki</i>). She puts mehandi (henna). After 5 days
            sathiya mandathe hai (swastik is drawn). Put kohl on the roti, worship <i>Baimata</i>,
            light a lamp and eat. Pair mandathe hai (make foot impressions) and then goes in
            the house.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            <i>Baimata</i> roams around everywhere for 5 days. Only after the 5th day she goes
            to somebody else's house. <i>Dai</i> also goes to somebody else's house
            after the 5th day. <i>Baimata</i> goes to every one's house.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Keshar Bai: After birth, <em>boba pilathe hain</em> (baby is put on the breast).
            The first milk is given under the calmness of the stars. A ring is put on the <em>boba</em>
            (nipple) and milk is taken out in the plate. On the kasa thali (plate made out of
            a mixed metal) the <i>Nanad </i>(husband's sister) cleans the breast and then
            the baby is made to drink from the new mother's breast. <em>Gur</em> and milk
            <em>ghutti</em> (decoction) is given <i>Nanad </i>is given <em>naek</em> (ritual
            gift/money).
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Mohini: We spread <i>mitti </i>. Ask the woman to apply force by holding a pole.
            If it is the first baby then sometimes during birth the woman stands for birth.
            (Mohini gets very animated and she gets up and begins dramatizing and intensely
            acting out). Once a <i>jacha </i>bit me during birth. She bit me at two places on
            my legs then I slapped her. The <i>jacha </i>is sometimes very agitated but <i>Dai</i>
            gives love. During birth we ask the other women from the house to hold the <i>jacha
            </i>'s abdomen.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Prema: After birth if the child does not <em>baal-saad</em> (first cry) and<em> bache
                ko dunga latkate hain</em> (child is hung up side down). We give<em> phunkani</em>
            (to blow). We slap the back of the child and also sprinkle cold water. If the child
            still does not cry then we warm up <i>anwal </i>. We burn the coal and warm up <i>anwal
            </i>on it.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Rukma: If the <i>anwal </i>is retained than we massage with our hands and take it
            out. In a village a childbirth was to happen in a Bishnoy's (a caste group)
            house. The baby had died in the womb. Doctor saw her but got very scared and refused
            to touch her. He could not do it. They were ready to go to a hospital. They asked
            me and I took out the dead baby. Baby was in the thaili. I sat in the front of the
            <i>jacha </i>wore gloves and took the baby out. When the woman had pains in the
            early months then blood clots had come out. She used to eat coal and <em>chikani</em>
            <i>mitti </i>(clay), which got stored around baby's body. This can happen.
            I took out the baby and cleaned baby's body. Then <i>jacha </i>'s father
            gave 1000 rupees to me as a reward.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Savitri: Are there any other danger signs at the time of birth? Tell them too.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Paana: Legs swell up. Nails become pale. We tell them to have a good diet from the
            early months itself. The woman does all household work, outside work, brings water,
            she gets no time to eat. Therefore she becomes weak. Earlier <em>ghee-milk</em>,
            <em>tillo ka tel</em>(sesame oil) and <em>gur</em> (jaggery) were given. At the
            time of <i>japa</i> (birth) women's legs are kept in the front, sometimes the
            <i>Dai</i> makes the woman sit on her legs. If the baby does not cry immediately
            (baal-sadh) after birth then we hang the baby upside down, slap baby's legs
            and softly slap the head and the lower back.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Keshar Bai: Then cut the <i>naal</i> We bury the <i>anwal </i>with <em>kumkum</em>(red
            powder) and a ring. We bury it in a straight position. It id said that if you put
            it in <i>ulta</i> position the baby will vomit. The baby can fall ill. If the baby
            later falls ill then at the time of menstruation, the <i>anwal </i>is taken out
            and washed, the baby is bathed and made to lie down and sleep.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Prema: At birth we warm up the <i>mitti </i>and spread. Lot of water comes out in
            some cases.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Mohini: After birth, we take little blood from the <i>anwal </i>dip cotton in it
            and make the baby lick it.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: Do you always do this?</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            <i>Dai</i>: Yes, we all do this.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Mohini: With our finger we take some blood from the <i>anwal </i>and make the baby
            lick it. By this the baby will not have <em>saans ki bimari</em>(respiratory diseases).
            The baby will not get uparla (pneumonia). At the time of <i>japa</i> we keep a chulha(wood
            stove) lighted. We do not put<em> foons</em> (hay) in it or else the baby may get
            <em>funsi</em> (rashes). After birth we boil water on the fire lighted by using
            foons and bathe the women. We do not give food to the women in kasa plate. From
            the earthern pot the woman must not be given the first lota of water. If it is given
            then the baby might get uprala(pneumonia). After birth the woman should not eat
            or drink very fast.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Keshar Bai: After birth massage is done for the woman. Head is massaged, lower back
            is massaged. She feels relaxed. With <em>loi</em> (a wet mixture of flour, turmeric
            powder, <i>ghee</i>) the new mother is massaged and the baby is bathed with warm
            water. We put <em>Raang ki jar </em>(some kind of root) in the water and make <i>jacha
            </i>sit, for a while in the water. This is done for 2-3 days we put this water in
            a <em>karahi</em> (deep utensil).This also helps in closing of the <i>shareer</i>.
            If at time of birth the <em>bachedani ka muh</em> does not open then we put oil
            in our fingers and massage. If the mouth of the uterus is very hard then by massage
            it opens.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Paana: A woman&#8217;s delivery was conducted in the hospital because she was very
            short. First she had <em>kasuliya</em> (false pain). One should not apply force
            at <i>japa</i> (birth). By the force the <i>shareer</i> may get a tear. If there
            is a tear then we put a chopa of <i>ajwain</i> and <i>ghee</i> (paste of <i>ajwain</i>
            and <i>ghee</i>). At <i>japa</i> the <i>shareer</i> may tear but it heals on its
            own.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Mohini: The woman sweats when the baby is about to come out. As the time moves for
            the birth she starts sweating more. Her <em>sauth</em>( thighs) start shaking. Then<em>
                desu</em> breaks. The baby starts coming out. In one out of 100 cases a black
            balloon (bag of waters containing meconium) comes out which the <i>Dai</i> has to
            break.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: How many <i>japa</i>s(birth) have you attended?
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">

        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Mohini: There is a girl in my house who was born with 18 fingers. I cut few of them
            with the blade.

        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Now she has six fingers in each hand. This happens at times.</p>

            All <i>Dai</i>: Yes this happens. One pregnant woman cleaned a milk can at the time
            of eclipse, she had a daughter who was blind. Eclipse is dangerous for pregnant
            woman. If she cuts vegetables with knife then the child's lips or nose or ear
            or any other part of the body will have a tear or the baby has a mark on the body.
            If the woman sees the eclipse then the baby becomes deaf.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: Tell us about some<em> reeti-rewaz</em>(rituals-customs) that are done at
            the time of birth?</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Prema: When the pain starts <i>Dai</i> is called. The <i>Dai</i> sees whether the
            baby is <i>ulta</i>(breech) or <i>seedha</i> (head-down position). The woman is
            made to sit and <i>Dai</i> puts her legs on the inner portion of the woman's
            thigh. <i>Dai</i> gives <em>baal-sadh</em> (first cry) to the baby. Rolls up a paper
            and blows air to help baby breathe. Then she ties up the new mother's abdomen,
            combs her hair. Cuts the <em>nara</em>. The new mother is made to lie on the cot
            and all around the cot munja (coconut husk) is kept.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            After 5 days there is Chhati Puja. Churma(a sweet dish)is made, <i>jacha </i>puts
            henna, <i>Baimata</i> is drawn and a black<em> tota</em> (amulet) is tied on the
            baby. The <em>Pandit</em>(priest)looks at the <em>patra</em> (horoscope) and if
            he says that the baby is <em>mangal nachatra</em> ( mangal star). The <em>dakauth</em>
            is given grain (Dakauth is a woman who receives oil to appease <em>mangal shani</em>(stars).
            Tilak (a red long line on the forehead that is put after <em>puja</em>) is put for
            woman and kohl is also applied in her eyes.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Paana: If the Pandit (priest) sees <em>nashatra</em> (certain stars) then the name
            of the baby is taken on 21st or on the 27th day. <em>Dakauth</em> is given black
            cloth, oil and grains. After giving, the dakauth is sent out of the house, early
            in the morning, in the dark around 4.am so that nobody sees her. The <em>Dakauth</em>
            should not turn around and see anybody this is very important.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Prema: <em>Pandit</em> takes out the name for the baby and clothes are given to
            the <i>Nanad </i>(husband's sister). All the neighborhood women come and sing
            songs. There is <em>jalwa-puja</em> (it is done after 25, 30 or 40 days after birth).
            Wheat or moong dal (pulses) is soaked in water and ghugari (some dish) is made and
            distributed.<em> Kuan pujan</em> (well worship) is done. <em>Churma ke laddu</em>
            (roti is crushed and mixed with <i>ghee</i> and then made into balls) is offered
            at the well. Only after this the <i>jacha </i>is allowed to touch the earthen pots
            (an analogy between the pot and the woman, transformation takes place in the pot

            may be fresh in your memory.<br />
            Prema: My <em>bhabhi</em>(elder brother's wife) had 2 children, both died.
            Then a <em>gaanth</em> (knot) came out from her stomach. <em>Bhabi</em> was ill
            and then she died. In my village there was another woman who had her first <i>japa</i>
            (birth) and she was very afraid. The doctor gave her injection and she was very
            afraid of injections. The two children were born alright and both started crying.
            I said that <i>anwal </i>(placenta) has not come out. After the <i>anwal </i>(placenta)
            was delivered I told her that she has got one boy and one girl baby. The <i>jacha </i>
            (pregnant woman) was weak so I told that she should be given lot of milk with little
            <i>ghee</i> in it. So that she could feed the babies properly. Now the children
            are nice and big.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            I had 2 <em>bhabhis</em>. After the death of the first one my brother married again.
            The <em>chhoti</em> (younger) bhabhi was five months pregnant and at that time the
            elder bhabhis' <em>chhaya</em> (shadow) fell on her. <em>Chhoti</em> bhabhi
            used to say in the elder <em>bhabhi's</em> voice that she would kill her (<em>chhoti</em>
            <em>bhabhi</em>). She had the baby. She was going to her <i>pihar</i>(mother's
            house), the baby was with the <i>Saas</i> (mother-in-law) . She asked for her little
            baby but the <i>Saas</i> refused. On Wednesday, the brother took <em>bhabhi</em>
            to her <i>pihar</i>. And on next Wednesday she died. Her husband did dora (taking
            away negativity)and came home. At night he was lying down and smoking biri (local
            cigarette made of leaf and tobacco). The biri fell all by itself.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Bhabhi had gone to <em>kund</em>(well) with a <em>lota</em>(small metal pot). It
            was <em>amavasya</em>(no moon night), when she was putting the lota to fetch water
            she slipped and fell in the kund. If she had carried the baby with her then the
            baby would have also fallen and died. Four men took her body out of the kund, there
            were no clothes on her body. My brother was called, he told father about it. My
            father said that the body should be cremated and there was no police case.</p>

            My first <em>bhabhi</em> had 3 children. The first got <em>dhowan</em> (some kind

            also died. In my <em>bari</em> <em>bhabhi</em> some <em>musalmani</em>(muslim woman's)
            <em>chaya</em> ( shadow) had come on her. The <em>Brahmin</em> does a <em>dora</em>(ritual

            The <em>chhoti</em> <em>bhabhi</em> died in the kund. Her child is there and is

            and killed her. (This is the <em>chhoti</em> <em>bhabhi's</em> spirit killing
            her own <em>bhabhi</em> later on). Many women have died in the kund.</p>

            eat death for 12 days. I die, but after my death 2 quintals of grains are <em>khinda</em>(scattered,

            pains were going up. I told that it is not possible to have the baby here then she
            was taken to <em>Lunsarankar</em> hospital. Over there the doctor refused. It was
            10:00 O&#8217; clock at night and I said the delivery should be done here and she
            was admitted. With lot of problems she had a girl baby. But the baby died. The baby

            I did <i>japa</i> of a 12 year old girl. I took lot of care, made <i>karha</i> (decoction)
            and gave her to drink. The bachedani ka muh was very small and was not opening.
            I slowly massaged her <i>shareer</i>. And poked her <em>thaili</em> with <em>viti</em>.
            With <em>viti</em> we break the thaili. If we do with our nails than jahar fail
            jata hai (poison spreads, <i>Dai</i> know about infection). I poked with the viti
            and the baby started coming out. The head started coming out. When a <i>Dai</i>

            Rukma: There was a baby born during the seventh month (<em>satmahi</em>). In the

            and nutmeg. It was 11:00 O&#8217; clock at night. Baby's hands came out first,
            the baby had crossed its legs inside and it was a very difficult <i>japa</i>. I
            took out the baby somehow. That woman's <i>Devrani</i> and <i>Jethani</i> were
            sleeping, only I was there with her. Made the baby do <em>baal-saadh</em> and then
            put the baby next to the mother. At 4:00 p.m. the baby died. I woke the family.
            I asked for <em>handi</em> (earthen pot), misers gave a very small <em>handi</em>.
            Even that small baby could not lie in it. The neighbors and relatives requested
            that I come with them. I took the baby in the <em>handi</em> and buried it. They
            gave 10 rupees but I did not take it. I said if you really want to give then give

            come out. Gave her brahmi ki goli and I went home. Her family members came to pick
            me up. I went with them and said that it will take some time now. It was night.

            I only had severe pain in my head and nowhere else. I kept on doing my work. When
            I went to pass urine the baby came out in the thasla (wide bowl). My <em>sasur</em>
            (father-in-law) started scolding my <em>Saasu</em>(mother-in-law) that she was not
            taking care. She said that she did not know about it as I did not say anything.
            I said that I myself did not know about it. <i>Dai</i> was called, she came immediately

            Uma: If the <i>anwal </i>is not out then we put <i>jacha </i>'s hair in her

            Sayar: We hold the upper portion of the abdomen and press from both sides. Then

            Rukma: <em>Pagawani</em> (buttocks first) is not difficult but the neck may get

        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Rukma: After the <i>anwal </i>is expelled lot of care is taken of the <i>anwal </i>
            . We seek the protection of <i>anwal </i>for the happiness of the child. So the
            <i>anwal </i>is buried along with blade, money, grains and jaggery. The <i>naal</i>
            is kept very safely because <i>naal</i> is crushed and given to drink, to women
            who do not bear children. And her womb starts functioning.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Manohari: I have kept <i>naal</i> of all my seven children very safely (all of them
            say that they have kept their children's <i>naal</i> very safely, tied in a
            cloth). The <i>naal</i> that sheds in saawan (rainy season) is kept very safely.</p>

            If <em>bael badhini hai</em> (literally-if the vine is to grow or if one is to have

            Manohari: The new mother can also cut the <i>naal</i>. If she is not able, then
            <i>Dai</i> cuts it. <i>Dai</i> Mai (<i>Dai</i> mother) is as lovable as a mother.
            Either <i>Dai</i> cuts the <i>naal</i> or the new mother cuts it because <i>Dai</i>
            <em>Mai Vaid Kasai</em> (a saying that <i>Dai</i> is like mother, vaid and a butcher).
            <i>Dai</i> Mai only cuts the <i>naal</i>a and nobody else because it&#8217;s a <em>dosh</em>
            (blemish or transgression). There is life in <i>naal</i> equivalent to the life
            of a baby. <i>naal</i> has <em>bahater</em> <em>naari</em> (seventy-two veins or
            vessels or meridians) and by cutting one commits paap (sin). It is a sin even if
            the mother cuts the <i>naal</i> but it is less <em>paap</em>. The new mother gives
            grain, money and jaggery in the name of religion and the burden of sin becomes less.<br />
            Sayar: <i>Dai</i> cuts the <i>naal</i> and for cutting she gets nothing. She washes
            clothes, cuts seventy-two veins (<i>naal</i>) still she does not get anything substantial.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Manohari: There is a story on this and people still believe it. Somebody did not
            give anything to the <i>Dai</i> for cutting the <i>naal</i>. So <i>Dai</i> takes
            the <i>naal</i>a with her to hell. She keeps the <i>naal</i>a in between her teeth
            and asks the child for neak (ritual gift/money). Child says take it from my mother
            but the mother also refuses. Then <i>Dai</i> says that I washed your dirty clothes
            and also cut your seventy-two <i>naal</i>a and you gave me nothing so you are in
            debt and the debt will carry on with me. So now you should return the debt or else
            I will follow you and will not leave you. On this the mother says that here I have
            nothing so what can I give you? Bhagwan tells the mother that she should cut her
            <em>jaangh</em> (thigh) and give and mother gives her thigh and is rescued from
            the <i>Dai</i>.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Jarau: When <i>Dai</i> goes for delivery then she folds her hand to <em>Bhagwan</em>.
            If the new mother does not give <em>neak</em> to <i>Dai</i> for cutting the <i>naal</i>a
            then <i>Dai</i> offers prasad (things offered perhaps to <em>Bhagwan</em> or to
            devils or ancestors), so that the blame on her becomes less.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Manohari: If we do many <i>japa</i>as and cut many <i>naal</i>s then the blame on
            us is too much. All <i>Dai</i> believe this. If the new mother is mature then she
            herself cuts the <i>naal</i> so that in next birth <i>Dai</i> is not burdened and
            has less blame.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Before <em>Raj</em> <i>Dai</i> used to cut the <i>naal</i>a. She used to do everything
            for the baby (bathing washing clothes and taking care of the baby). Nayikini(nayak
            caste) used to be the Raj <i>Dai</i>. Nayakini used to work when kings used to rule.
            They delivered the babies of the kings and were given neak. They took care of the
            baby and massaged the new mother till the name was given for the baby. At the time
            of naming of the babies too, the <i>Dai</i> was given neak. Raj <i>Dai</i> got fixed
            money of rupees 300-400/ from the government like getting wages. She did <i>Dai</i>'
            work for the whole village and used to earn her living.

            If she had two <i>Bahu</i>s than the village was divided equally for their service.
            They used to serve the villages that fell in their share. In a village there could
            be two Raj <i>Dai</i>. But they were of the same family (with the abolition of princely
            states this system also got abolished but perhaps for a long time the families of
            Raj <i>Dai</i> were referred to as Raj <i>Dai</i>. This is what one could gather
            from the discussion).</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Sayar: These days because of our association with Urmul and the training, people
            think of us as Raj <i>Dai</i>. Because of training people give us nothing after
            <i>japa</i>. They believe that government is giving us money so how can we also
            take money from them. Therefore village people do not give neak.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Guddi: We <i>Dai</i> can handle all sort of problems. If a woman is bleeding then
            the leg side portion of the bed is lifted and the head side is lowered and she stops
            bleeding. For one woman the baby had come low and she started bleeding. Doctor said
            that the blood group of husband and wife were not matching and therefore there was
            bleeding. <i>Dai</i> said that if the blood was not matching then how could she
            conceive. Then the <i>Dai</i> put a sack below her and <em>paet ki nari daba di </em>
            pressed a vein of the abdomen and the bleeding stopped.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Manohari: In training we are told to cut the <i>naal</i> after the baby is expelled
            and not to wait for the <i>anwal </i>to be expelled. We are told that if the woman
            is to be taken somewhere then it will be a problem with an uncut <i>naal</i>.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            But we do not cut. If the baby does not cry or is not breathing then we heat the
            <i>anwal </i>and make the baby breathe. We do not have any arrangement beside this.
            If something happens to the baby then that family will spoil our name. They will
            say, &quot;She thinks she is very smart because of training&quot;. Doctors are educated
            so if they do something then they are not blamed. They have machines and other arrangement
            and can help the baby breathe. But our hands and feet are tied (our resources are
            limited).</p>

            <u><strong>Gola </strong></u>
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Manohari: After birth of the baby, woman has pains in the <em>gola</em>(perhaps
            the pain caused by the involution of the uterus or and the <em>gola</em> is some
            form of energy, power). Because when the baby is in the womb then <em>bache ka rakshak
                vo gola hota hai </em>(<em>gola</em> is the protector of the baby). <em>Gola</em>
            is located beside the baby. After birth gola is left alone so it looks for the baby
            in the womb. And this gives pain to the new mother. Therefore we immediately give
            warm <i>seera </i>(halwa, sweet mixture made out of flour, sugar and <i>ghee</i>)
            to eat and this foments the gola. Warm pot is placed on the abdomen for fomentation.
            This eases her pain.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Guddi: This is a <em>gola</em> of<em> jama hua khoon</em> (thickened, coagulated,
            collected blood). It bleeds out in three days and the abdomen is cured.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Manohari: <em>Gola</em> can be felt on touching the abdomen. It gets cured on its
            own. Some women get lots of pain from <em>gola</em> and some have less pain. If
            it is very painful then goli is given (the name of the goli was not told &amp; they
            said that in any medical shop if you ask for <em>gole ki dard ki goli</em>--tablet
            for the gola pain-- it is given to you). By fomentation however the pain subsides.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Sayar: Besides the <em>gola</em> for <i>jacha </i>, there is a gola in the abdomen
            of men and women. Everyone has this gola. Pain is below <em>sundi</em> (navel),
            on the left side. The person suffering from gola pain gets diarrhea. This is called
            <em>gola parna</em> (to have gola pain). We massage the abdomen and bring the nari
            at the level of <em>sundi</em> and pull the legs to recover from the pain and <em>diarrhea</em>.
            The <em>gola</em> of the <i>jacha </i>is different and all jachas suffer from it.

            Manohari: After delivery the women is made to stand and the <i>Dai</i> puts her
            head against the women's abdomen. She takes out all the thickened, coagulated,
            collected blood (<em>jama hua khoon</em>). This is called <em>kala khoon</em> (
            black blood) .Later we make the women sit and put our heel on her <i>shareer</i>
            (vagina).By this her <i>shareer</i> does not come out.</p>

            Manohari: <i>jacha </i>ka <i>shareer</i> <em>bethate hai</em> (they are referring
            to putting turmeric and <i>ghee</i> on the vagina while pushing the vagina and the
            uterus back into the woman's body) and then put <i>ghee</i> on the head as
            this cools the body. The <i>shareer</i> (vagina) is kacha (raw) at this time. First
            we massage the head and once it cools down then the body relaxes. Afterwards the
            whole <i>shareer</i> (body) is massaged. In winter, the head is massaged with <i>ghee</i>
            mixed with black pepper. Pipala mool (some herb) is also mixed with <i>ghee</i>
            for massage. In summer only <i>ghee</i> is used for massage and nothing is mixed
            with the <i>ghee</i>. If there is pain in <i>shareer</i> (vagina) then oil massage
            is done. This is done from the fourth day of delivery because for three days, the
            woman has bleeding. Its&#8217; only when the bleeding lessens, which is on the fourth
            day, that massage is done.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Sayar: With a mixture of wheat flour, turmeric and <i>ghee</i> the body of the new
            mother has to be massaged. By this the woman looks beautiful. This has been the
            tradition. Woman's hands, back, lower back, everything is massaged. The abdomen
            is massaged softly and is done in circular motion to set it. This flattens her abdomen.
            Till the name is given for the baby she does not bathe and at least till then she
            gets a massage. If some need it after that also then too we massage her. But usually
            they ask for seven or ten days.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Guddi: By massage her <i>shareer</i>(body) becomes <em>kawala</em>(?) and soft.
            <em>Pithi</em>(mixture of turmeric, flour and <i>ghee</i>) makes her look beautiful,
            her complexion clears up. After a bath she looks like a newly wedded bride.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Sayar: The root of <i>Rangjhar</i> is boiled in the water, then the water is cooled
            a little and the woman is made to sit in that tub. This cleans her <em>sharer</em>
            (vagina) and also warm fomentation is done on her <i>shareer</i> and protects it
            from infection. We definitely do it for two-three days. If she has itching in her
            <i>shareer</i> then we light a fire and then put hair and bhojpath (some herb) in
            the fire and do <em>dhuni</em> (to give smoke on vagina). This stops the itching.
            If she gets a tear at delivery then cotton dipped in turmeric and <i>ghee</i> is
            placed on the <i>shareer</i>. This helps to heal.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">

            Sayar: On the day of <em>chhati</em>, <i>Baimata</i> writes the fate of the baby.
            Nobody can change what <i>Baimata</i> writes. There is a story. A boy went out to
            tend the cattle. He saw an old woman. He asked her what she was doing here. She
            said, &quot; I am <i>Baimata</i> and I write everyone's fate&quot;. Then the
            boy asked her where will I get married? Then <i>Baimata</i> said in one village
            there is a Brahmin who has a very beautiful daughter. You will sell shoes and you
            will marry the Brahmins' daughter. The boy said,&quot; I make shoes (cobbler,
            a low caste) how can a Brahmin let his daughter marry me?&#8221; The Brahmin was
            looking for a bridegroom. He could not find a proper groom for his daughter. At
            that time the same boy was selling shoes in that village. The Brahmins' wife
            said to marry off the daughter to this boy. And the girl was married to him. So
            <i>Baimata</i> can write anything in one's fate.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Sayar: On the day of the chhati, the baby is made to wear new clothes (before the
            baby used to wear no clothes but these days we put old clothes). At 4 p.m. we draw
            <i>Baimata</i> (<i>Dai</i> drew a <i>Baimata</i> and showed us). <em>Sathiya</em>
            (Swastik) is made. Put <i>tika </i>(a red mark). Keep wheat or millet. Keep two
            <em>rotis</em> and four <em>pind</em> and one <em>pindya</em>( roti is broken and

            45 days or 60 days. It's only after <em>jalwa</em> <em>puja</em> that the new
            mother can start her routine chores.<br />
            Manohari: This is because after delivery<em> nau mahine ka narak nikalta hai</em>(nine
            months demonic-unclean &quot;hell&quot; comes out). This is also called<em> narak ka
                kund</em> (reservoir of the demonic-unclean). After birth the accumulated blood

            The woman goes to her <i>pihar</i> for the birth but she is not sent on eighth month

            month she may have her baby on the way. Eighth month baby do not survive because
            it is like wood. On seventh month <em>bayasi puja</em> is done at home, Rice and
            lapasi (gruel made of <em>aata</em>, sugar and <i>ghee</i>) is used for the puja.

            If a woman goes out during delivery then she is given iron, otherwise <em>bhooth-preth</em>(evil

            from twelve noon till three o'clock and in the evening after eight is time
            of <em>bhooth-preth</em>. If the <em>bhooth</em> catches then dora or <em>jantar</em>

        <p align="justify" class="default">
            <em>Bhooth-preth</em>can also follow the <i>Dai</i> because she returns home at
            odd hours and also because she puts her hands in sooye (uncleanness of child birth).
            Therefore families do not let her return at odd hours if it gets very late then

            we are trying for, will slowly, we hope will get you more money and improve your
            work situation.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Sayar: Half of our life is over like this now.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: We know that you all have a special knowledge. Therefore we respect you
            from our hearts. We have tried to know and understand you and will try more the
            next time when we meet.<br />
            (The <i>Dai</i> and the Urmul workers ended the meeting singing and dancing)

        <p align="center" class="lrgtxt2">
            Day 3 26.5.98<br />
            Morning Session: 8a.m to 10.am</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            <strong><u>Meeting with Urmul members</u></strong></p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: We will talk about goals. What is Matrika's goal in workshop and what
            is Urmul's goal. This should be very clear so that you can do some work in
            your area and we can do some work and some we can do together.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Ramratni: How was the workshop?</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: Now lets' make an evaluation of good things and bad things of the workshop.
            There are some bad things and there are many good things. First, you gave immense
            cooperation. We could not have done this work without your assistance. In a situation
            where there is a language problem, we don't know <i>Marwari</i> language, you
            helped us in translation and documentation and this was very important. Help given
            by Ramratni, Kanta and Savitri were very important and we will be needing it in
            the future also.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Even from <i>Dai</i>, whatever we wanted to know was very deep information. We felt
            that in Urmul you were working according to your traditional systems. You are giving
            training that is based on the western system so there was a possibility that the
            <i>Dai</i> would not be able to talk about traditional methods or would not talk
            deeply about these methods.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            But you gave them the permission to talk freely and openly about it so it seems
            our goal and your goal is the same. In future too we can work together and it will
            not be limited till the workshop only. On the basis of the information that we are
            gathering we can do something like what you are saying: a new model for the <i>Dai</i>.
            We can help prepare that.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            In my session in the evening when <i>Dai</i> were sharing their experiences of birth
            they also talked about their experiences of death. In our country, which is poverty
            stricken so many deaths occur, &quot;the government&quot; has no understanding of
            the deep root causes. The government talks of infectious diseases but how changes
            can be brought about within the state of poverty, on this, the government has done
            nothing till now. We have to think in this context. For instance, by giving plastic
            sheets the infectious diseases cannot be wiped out. How much of plastic sheets can
            be given. They are not appropriate. And there is always this dependence of getting
            it from someone. Sand soaks up the blood and is not dependent on outsiders.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: We thought that if we start it once then it will get ingrained in
            their mind that it is necessary and that plastic sheet is hygienic. We knew that
            plastic sheet will not work but once the <i>Dai</i> get used to it then they will
            buy it. They will be forced to think about it.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            (The fact that the Urmul people have stopped the tradition of using <i>mitti </i>
            and have started giving plastic sheet for delivery is discussed. Some spread cloth
            on top of plastic sheet)</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: There is water problem and the washing of the plastic sheet with water is
            a big question? I feel that the villagers and the <i>Dai</i> do not even get as
            much water as you are getting here.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Ramratni and Savitri: There is acute shortage of water and they have to carry water
            from far off places.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: How can they clean the plastic sheet or the cloth-sheet in this situation?
            And the use of plastic sheet has increased <i>Dai</i>' work. In my session
            the <i>Dai</i> said that the villagers agree on using it if the <i>Dai</i> cleans
            the plastic sheet. (Uma agreed on this). Therefore <i>Dai</i> work increases. She
            cleans it for three days then only women agree to spread it. So there is this question
            of jati if the <i>Dai</i> is from Nayak jati then she will clean it but others will
            not do it.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            <i>Dai</i> talked about the problem of using the plastic sheet openly and it seems
            that it is a big problem. We are not saying that you (Urmul) have done something
            wrong. But looking at the extent of the <i>Dai</i> dissatisfaction, we are not able
            to understand your decision to use the sheets. We can give our opinions, but it
            is you who have to deal with this problem.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: We were told by the doctors who came here and by Sunil Kaul that <i>mitti
            </i>is dirty and women have to be protected so in our mind we thought only of cleanliness.
            We did not think whether it will be possible to use the sheets or about other problems.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: A study should be done on the differences caused by what is being used now
            and what was being used before. What diseases the women have and what they don't
            have. Last time when we came here then you told us that by spreading <i>mitti </i>
            the woman gets white discharge.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            In March we had gone for a gathering of traditional healers, there women said that
            in their areas there is a serious problem of white discharge. In some places, like
            in Bihar, 70-80% women have it (get it specially after first delivery). So in different
            situations women all over have this problem. Therefore there is some other factor
            involved too. These organizations are thinking of doing some work on it. White discharge
            is also because of bacteria. Therefore we cannot conclude that it is only caused
            by sand. There is a need to see other aspects also like the woman's food intake
            and other things.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: It is true that women are reluctant to use plastic sheets. We are
            facing lot of problem. <i>Dai</i> and the women themselves want to use sand. They
            have no problem in using the things of <i>Mamta kit</i>. They do not oppose in using
            the gloves because they find it easy. So what is easy is also easy to impose.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: It is not just a matter of easy methods but also of faith. The methods in
            which they have faith and those that can be reasoned out by you and us these they
            accept. But where they have stronger reasons for continuing their own methods, there
            is a problem if we cannot reason it out. It is the same with the cutting of the
            <i>naal</i> also. You gave the reason, as problem of transporting the woman and
            it is not very convincing.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: Yes they also cut the <i>naal</i> later, because if something goes
            wrong then a lot of people to blame her, like, the educated doctors. And if <i>Dai</i>
            makes mistake then the <i>Dai</i> will be defamed.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: This is not the only reason. There are reasons for cutting it later and
            the <i>Dai</i> knows those reasons. She knows that from <i>anwal </i>through <i>naal</i>
            the blood goes to the baby. If the baby is not breathing then she can warm up the
            <i>anwal </i>and make the baby breathe. This has been said by <i>Dai</i> of all
            areas. They also said that doctors have machines through which they can make the
            baby breathe but they only have this method.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: They also recognize the fact that it is not to be done for everyone. They
            said that if a baby turns blue or dies in the womb then there is no use in warming
            the <i>anwal </i>. It means that they know it.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: They know a lot and they also have so much experience and our goal is to
            understand their knowledge.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: What we tell them about birth during training-- that much they know
            as per their methods. They need more new information therefore there is a need of
            a new model.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: They have an interest in new ideas. Yesterday in the Birth Atlas session
            they asked why often the fetus gets miscarried within the first three months. If
            we can explain these kind of queries in simple language then they will definitely
            get a lot of help.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: We tell them to go to doctors.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: While showing the Birth Atlas we can tell them that till third month the
            baby is not stable and if there is some congenital problem with the baby then it
            will not stay. Therefore many babies get aborted or miscarried within the first
            three months. And <i>Dai</i> will understand this.<br />
            Satyanarayan: They also say that eighth month baby cannot survive but seventh month
            can. But they do not give any reason for it.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: They have their experience and must have seen it happening.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: There is a need to study, do research on it.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: We will say (based on western medicine and medical science) that the
            seventh month baby is weaker then the eighth month baby and therefore will not survive
            (since the eighth month old baby gets a month more) and the eighth month baby will
            survive.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: You have to see their strength that they can save the seventh month baby.
            In cities doctors keep the babies in the incubator to regulate the temperature.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satosh: Here they keep the baby rolled in cotton.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: The main thing is temperature and this they know.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: And it is not necessary that after spending so much in the hospital
            the baby would survive. Many children do not survive. And <i>Dai</i> manage to save
            children whose birth weight is one or two kilos. Therefore some research should
            be done so that it can be included in the new model.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Ramratni: The new model should also include why there is miscarriage in the third
            month, the seventh month baby survives but not the eighth month baby. Why women
            are anemic and what can be done to increase pain.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: Yes, the <i>Dai</i> were asking that the doctors can give <i>sui</i> or <i>tika
            </i>(injections) and we cannot give this so what else can we do?</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: We do stop them from giving <i>tika </i>(injection).</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: We want to tell you, for your information that in many villages like yours,
            <i>tika </i>has reached. In Bihar where we did our workshop and is like your villages
            there is a relationship between <i>Dai</i> and compounder and <i>Dai</i> immediately
            ask for injections. It has not reached here at that level.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Ramratni: Here the <i>Dai</i> gets irritated if the nurse comes.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: This is a question of power and separation. In presence of a doctor,
            nurse is not asked, and in presence of nurse <i>Dai</i> is not asked for. Nurse
            comes and gives glucose and <i>sui</i> and it seems that something will happen with
            these things. Therefore <i>Dai</i> gets irritated with a nurse.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: It will be a challenge for them and therefore <i>Dai</i> are worried about
            how they can learn more so that they have an influence.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: So complete information should be given on <i>sui</i> .We should also understand
            when and in what condition <i>sui</i> is to be given. How it can harm that is also
            to be told in detail. It is very common in Bihar and is much more in Delhi. In these
            areas, even <i>Dai</i> training is being given by government and non-government
            organizations. In other words, they get the validation for giving <i>sui</i>. But
            when the <i>sui</i> is to be given is very important. Like Paana said that in one
            <i>japa</i> the family was asking for <i>tika </i>to be given but the <i>Dai</i>
            was refusing the whole night because the woman was getting kacha dard and that if
            <i>tika </i>is given now then bachadani may be damaged. This is correct and if there
            is a need for <i>sui</i> then it should be given only in pakka dard. The <i>sui</i>
            (oxytocin or pitocin) immediately increases pains and if administered in kachha
            dard then it is not safe. This injection was started to expel placenta or to control
            post partum bleeding but it is being misused.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Ramratni: Here one or two women have died because <i>sui</i> was given at the time
            of kacha dard.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: <i>Dai</i> were also saying that we should tell them more about <i>sui</i>
            because when <i>Dai</i> refuses for <i>sui</i> then families say that nurse is more
            educated then you and she does not refuse then why do you say no. So we can also
            help them on this by giving more information on <i>sui</i>.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: You work in villages so you could keep a note on the deaths during delivery
            and the reasons for the death. Whether <i>mitti </i>was used or cloth sheet was
            used or plastic sheet was used? If she was ill and if the illness was the cause
            of her death. Second, how many cut the <i>naal</i> before the <i>anwal </i>comes
            out and how many cut after the <i>anwal </i>is out?</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Ramratni: Nobody cuts it before everybody cuts it later.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: Because they have a solid reason behind it. In Bihar, a health workers'
            <i>Devrani</i>(husbands' younger brothers' wife) died during delivery.
            We made a detailed report on it and did lot of research on the various reasons that
            could have caused the death. If something like this happens than write to us. And
            you too can look into the reasons.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Renuka: Here too there are these kinds of situations and problems. <i>Dai</i> were
            telling about it.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: There should be a detailed understanding on maternal deaths.<br />
            Ramratni: This will be very good.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: You send a questionnaire that has probable causes for death. Then
            the health workers can document properly and can talk with that family.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: We can do that. One more question, tell us something about the training
            of the Nirogi Sathees (health workers), how do you do it. May be we can help a little.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: They spend ten days with some doctor. The main training they get by
            being in the field. They learn about society and health, poverty and health, reasons
            for sickness and the major problems of that area. Everyone here is not a Nirogi
            Sathee. Only the ones who have got training are Nirogi Sathees. They do not have
            much knowledge on diseases nor do they have the doctors' knowledge but they
            understand the body fully. They have an understanding of the reasons for illness.
            Ramratni, Savitri, Uma, Paana Bai are Nirogi Sathees and will work with you in future
            also.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: Nirogi Sathees, tell us about your experience of this workshop?</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Uma: <i>Dai</i> were saying that little bit <i>naal</i> is cut and made into <em>tabeez</em>
            (amulet) and if the baby wears it then the baby does not suffer from pneumonia or
            breathing problem or uprala. How does this happen and is this right or wrong?
        </p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan: Like we put <i>tika</i>similarly this is their faith.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Uma: If <i>naal</i> is crushed and given to drink to a woman who is not having babies
            then that woman has a baby. The womb starts functioning.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: We have to understand this. But without understanding it we should not say
            that it is wrong or irrelevant.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Deepti: Many things have an effect depending on our psychological beliefs and faith.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Santosh: Many times, <i>Dai</i> trouble poor people for money and I feel bad about
            it and I have a different opinion on this with the organization.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Ramratni and Satyanarayan: <i>Dai</i> is also poor.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Santosh: I feel then what is the difference between the <i>Dai</i> and the doctor?
            If the woman is dying and the <i>Dai</i> says that without rupees 100/ I am not
            going to touch you?</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Satyanarayan and Ramratni: <i>Dai</i> knows that she is not going to get therefore
            she says this.<br />
            Ramratni: Village people say, why is she taking money from here or we will not give
            you because you are getting from the Urmul Trust.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Uma: It came out in our session too but it is not true. They get incentive for using
            <i>Mamta kit </i>(things to be used during delivery, given by Urmul Trust). And
            different amount is given like for using plastic sheet Rs. 25, for using gloves
            Rs. 5 etc. If everything in the <em>Manta</em> Kit is used then she gets Rs. 75
            but money is deducted for the things that have not been used. Like if plastic sheet
            is not used and <i>mitti </i>is used then Rs. 25 is deducted and she gets Rs. 50
            only. Similarly it is for other things.</p>
        <p align="justify" class="default">
            Madhu: <i>Dai</i> talked about it in detail and I felt very good that they could
