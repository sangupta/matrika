                            and <i>ajwain </i>with milk. In one and a half hours the baby was delivered. The
                            baby boy started screaming. My mother came running. I said cut the <i>naal </i>please.

                            with my <i>dai</i>, so I decided to go to hospital. I took a three-wheeler and reached
                            there, in the morning. The nurses were here and there, meanwhile I had my baby.
                            I held the baby with my own hands. I called the nurses and said &#8220;The baby
                            is out, come, otherwise I will throw it in the bucket&#8221;. (p.35)</li>

                            because at first I had wanted to abort the child. A lot of heat had formed inside
                            me. I showed this in many centres. Everyone said either you or your baby can be
                            saved. On 15th August I delivered the baby alone at night. I spread a <i>bori </i>
                            (gunny bag) on the floor. Spread a petticoat on top, and some torn clothes. We were
                            in a jhuggi , there was no light connection then. Somehow I delivered the baby,
                            but I lost consciousness. The baby was delivered and I was lying unconscious. My
                            husband heard the cry of the baby. He had been asleep. He saw that the baby has
                            come out. He got afraid. To cut the <i>naal </i>he called a nurse from &apos;G&apos;
                            block. Pushpa was also there. To revive me they said that I have had a girl. I got
                            up, saw that it was a boy, again I fainted. (p.36) </li>

                            turned the baby with my hands and asked her to apply force and the baby was out.
                            At the time of <i>Anwal</i> naal also I did the same thing. (p.36)</span><br />

                            Baby came out in the salwar itself. Baby was in its <i>jhilli</i> (membrane). I
