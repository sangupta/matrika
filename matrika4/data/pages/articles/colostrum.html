            Colostrum is low in fat, but high in carbohydrates and protein. It 
            is also very rich in vitamin A, a micronutrient that is essential 
            to good health, particularly in reventing blindness, as well as in 
            preventing infection.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            Colostrum contains antibodies that are effective in fighting infection 
            and keeping the baby healthy. It is easily digestible, making it the 
            perfect first food for a baby. Its laxative effect helps the baby 
            pass early stools, which aids in the excretion of excess bilirubin 
            and helps prevent jaundice.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            The first few days of breastfeeding are probably the most important 
            for a baby, and because the baby's stomach is very small he or she 
            will be able to consume only a small amount of protein at a time. 
            As a result, the baby will need to be fed nine or more times in a 
            24-hour period.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            Colostrum acts like a natural oral vaccine because it contains large 
            quantities of an antibody called secretory immunoglobin A (IgA). IgA 
            protects the baby's mucous membranes in the throat, lungs and intestines 
            from infection. Colostrum also has high concentrations of white blood 
            cells, called leukocytes, which fight bacteria and viruses.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            Colostrum is especially important in the gastrointestinal tract. A 
            newborn's intestines are very permeable. Colostrum helps seal the 
            permeable intestines by creating a barrier that helps prevent foreign 
            substances from penetrating and possibly sensitizing a baby to foods 
            the mother has eaten.</font></font></p>
          <p> <font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
            While these effects continue once the colostrum changes to milk, the 
        
            immunological response to viruses and bacteria is not as powerful 
            as in the
            beginning. However, the effects of the initial colostrum are long-lasting.
            Studies have shown that children who are breastfed rather than formula-fed 
            have
            a lower frequency of allergic, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
            and
            lymphomas in their later life when compared with children who have 
            been
            formula-fed after birth.</font></font></p>

            Besides these effects, colostrum has a positive effect on blood sugar 
            and aids 
            in development of the heart, lungs and brain.</font></font></p>

            In Brazil, where enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E. coli) diarrhea 
            is a<br />
            leading cause of morbidity and mortality in newborns, a study used 
            Western blot<br />
            analysis to determine the extent to which IgA in colostrum is reactive 
            with<br />
            enteropathogenic E. coli proteins. The analyses revealed that the 
            colostrum<br />
            samples contained a secretory immunoglobulin A that was reactive with 
            all the<br />
            virulence-associated proteins studied. Researchers concluded that 
            maternal<br />
            antibodies in colostrum may protect infants from E. coli infection 
            by<br />
            interfering with the attaching and effacing lesions brought on by 
            transmembrane<br />
            and intracellular signals caused by E. coli, and by cell signaling, 
            which<br />
            involves anti-enteropathogenic E. coli-secreted protein A and B antibodies.</font></font></p>

            A study determined that the anti-infective factors in the colostrums 
            of mothers<br />
            of preterm infants differ from those of mothers of full-term infants. 
            The 25<br />
            mothers were matched for age, parity, quality of nutrition and hemoglobulin<br />
            levels. In the mothers of preterm infants, the concentrations of total 
            protein<br />
            and the antimicrobial agents SigA, lysozyme and lactoferrin were significantly<br />
            greater than in the colostrums of the mothers of full-term infants, 
            although the<br />
            mean 12-hour volume of colostrums was significantly lower in the preterm 
            group.<br />
            The preterm colostrums also contained far higher counts of total cells,<br />
            macrophages, lymphocytes and neutrophils. Degree of prematurity correlated 
            with<br />
            volume, protein, concentration and cell and macrophage counts. The 
            study<br />
            concluded that although the volume of colostrums is lower the more 
            preterm the<br />
            infant, the quality is higher in terms of soluble anti-infective agents 
            and<br />
