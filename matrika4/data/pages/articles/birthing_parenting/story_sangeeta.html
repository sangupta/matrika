	I met Sangeeta at the Birth India Conference in Mubai in December 2007.
	I had heard that she had given birth at home, â€˜traditionallyâ€™, with poor
	local women acting as â€˜midwivesâ€™ and helping her have her baby the way
	she wanted to. I have taught childbirth preparation classes for 25 years
	and studied Indiaâ€™s birth traditions for almost as long, so I was
	interested. Who was this woman? How did she come to give birth in the
	way she didâ€”simply, at home, with no â€˜professionalsâ€™, technologies and
	pharmaceuticals? <br />
	<br />
	Well, I started asking questions at lunch over dosas and sambar, and
	listening to Sangeet and Hemant excitedly talk about their experiences
	with home birth. Before getting into their story, however, it is
	important for us to recognize that middle and upperclass women rarely
	(if ever) have babies at home. Poor women, both in rural and urban
	areas, often do, although the government is trying to â€˜institutionalizeâ€™
	birth for everybody (even though government facilities are often
	non-existent or not staffed). <br />
	<br />
	Sangeetaâ€™s story makes it sound so easy, but if you are considering a
	homebirth yourself, pay close attention to the beliefs, attitudes and
	daily health practices which she mentions. And also remember that
	Sangeeta had two empowering presences in her lifeâ€”her husband Hemant and
	Dr. Viyaya Venkat. But, letâ€™s let her tell her story. <br />
	<br />
	My first child, Anicca is 15 years old. I had to shop for a good gyne,
	who thought on the same lines then, Dr. Champa Nariani. At that time she
	said "Don't come to me too oftenâ€”only once every 3 months. Pregnancy and
	birth are natural processes." Also she told me that when I went into
	labor I should not to come to the hospital too early or else I would
	have a Cesarean section. It was a long laborâ€”there were only two things
	I didn't like. Pushing on my back and being separated from the baby
	after birth. <br />
	<br />
	We had wanted a home birth even then. Hemant himself was born at home.
	Both his buas were doctors and had delivered him. But when I was
	pregnant they said "But why take a risk? That was a long time ago and
	now there are so many good doctors and hospitals available." <br />
	<br />
	For the next birth, because I wanted a home birth, we didn't look for a
	gynae . Now times have changed but then it was difficult to find a gynae
	who would deliver at home. Dr. Vijaya Venkat is a nutritionist who was
	very close to Hemant even before we were married (she called him her son
	and me her daughter-in-law). She encouraged us. We were 100% sure from
	day one about having a home birth. We were living a healthy life,
	preparing our own foodâ€”why wouldn't we be able to do it? <br />
	<br />
	What's a healthy life? Well, I always had the opportunity of being in
	nature, eating healthy food, not taking medication. I grew up like this.
	My dad had always thought that fruits and nuts were healthy diets, we
	ate everything, even non-veg but it was balanced. <br />
	<br />
	Everything is interrelated, a healthy diet and a healthy mind. I had a
	wonderful childhood, parents took time with us, gave us priority, not a
	lot of material things, but time for us, not just the house, not just
	socializing. We received a lot of care as children. My parents had
	immense faith and trust in us when we were growing up, there was no fear
	when we went out, to school, to college. <br />
	<br />
	Our daughter Anicca who is now 15, she would travel from Andheri to
	Churchgate & back by herself at the age of 8... there was no fear, only
	trust life is safe & beautiful. Today she has full access to the
	internet, the freedom to be with male friends, to experience & enjoy
	true friends. Our son Aditya, 13, loves to play football & wants to be a
	drummer, steps out of the house chanting I'm safe & protected..... so
	what can go wrong? Faith and trust are so very important. <br />
	<br />
	Childbirth is a very special moment for the parents as well as the
	child. A home birth gives you the freedom to create a comfortable,
	beautiful ambience music, flowers, fragrance, candles and have your
	loved ones near you.... for the arrival of the special one. A hospital
	is a very good option in case of emergency. Its definitely not a
	beautiful place for delivery, there are assistants & doctors around to
	cater to your physical needs.... but what does a woman really want at a
	time like that? Tender loving care & moral support. <br />
	<br />
	I had an easy pregnancy, didn't go for any checkups, followed Vijaya
	Venkat's diet & was blessed with her guidance & support. We asked a dear
	friend of ours who had a home birth "what do you need for the
	delivery.... any kind of preparation"... she answered, "nothing, just
	keep an old sari under you.â€� <br />
	<br />
	Hemant organized everything for this birth. The delivery would be at the
	farm in Jhadpoli 3 hours from Bombay. At home there would have been too
	much confusion. We organized with the midwife for the due date, but we
	had no phone contact with her. Mild labour pains started at noon, my
	mother-in-law and daughter were with me. Hemant was out with a foreign
	client and could not be contacted. He didn't have a mobile in those days
	(1994) At 8 pm Hemant called and said he had to go out to dinner with
	this client. I said that it was time to go to the farm as I was in good
	labour. We were concerned about the ritual submerging of Ganpati on that
	dayâ€”that we might be stuck in traffic.No problem! We stopped to get the
	dai on the way but she said no I can't come, I have guests and can't
	goâ€”a wedding or something. They were all drinking. <br />
	<br />
	The caretaker at the farm said my mother and aunty are sort of dais.
	They had done a couple of deliveries. We knew everything would be all
	right when these women came into the room and first touched my abdomen
	and stayed there for a minute with eyes closed, praying silently. We
	knew they trusted the universe to get this baby born and we also trusted
	that. They and we were ready to leave it to god and being just an
	intermediary. They were very peaceful and said there is still time. They
	lay down and went to sleep saying "when you need us, call us." I was
	walking outside in the open, in nature, couldn't sleep. My body cleared
	itself, I vomitedâ€”no need of enema and allâ€”and my water broke. We were
	tired. Hemant gave me a nice massage, I actually slept for a few minutes
	after that. <br />
	<br />
	Aditya was born on September 19, 1994. He was born just before dawn. I
	was lying down. I had wanted to squat but they asked me to lie down. I
	thought that if they were more comfortable with that, okay. She asked me
	to put my legs up, with my feet next to my hips, and she put her feet on
	my hips. I pushed and he flew out effortlessly, a clean beautiful baby.
	"Is he still flying?" I asked. "Yes" she laughs, "He is a footballer,
	plays the drums, this 14 year old loves the family and is in sync with
	nature. <br />
	<br />
	My daughter was 2 Â½ and was squealing. She knew something was happening
	and we asked her to come and be with us as he was being born. All of us
	together at this moment, thanking the universe for the strength to trust
	the universe, the laws of nature and ourselves. The dai cut the cord
	with sterilized scissors we had brought, tied it, gave him a bath.
	Instantly the placenta had come out. It's traditional to bury the
	placenta and we did, under the roof of the house, outside, in the
	northwest direction. <br />
	<br />
	The old ladies from Jadpoli village came to see us and wept, saying that
	all their daughters were giving birth in the hospitals now and look at
	you. You did it at home. <br />
	<br />
	My parents were thrilled & zapped at the same time. Later my eldest
	sister had a home birth after without a midwife... It was just me & her.
	We cut the umbilical cord but forged an even more beautiful bond for the
	rest of our lives. <br />
	<br />
	Relatives do worry, they show concern. Hemant's cousin who is a gynae
	himself said to him "What you are doing is as good as pushing your wife
	from a high-rise building!" Well, he was born at home too. Were his
	parents stupid? No, they trusted the laws of the universe. Every one
	pestered my mum in law..... why are you letting them do this?, don't you
	have any say in the matter? But for us there are only plus & more plus
	points in a homebirth.
