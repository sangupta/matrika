	<h1>Know Your Rights</h1>
	<br />
	<h2>1. Know Your Rights<br />
	2. Way To Heal<br />
	3. How to File A Complaint</h2>
	Birthing practices around the world are changing. As women become more
	educated about their bodies, their babies and birthing and as they
	become more aware of their rights as a consumer and as a respected
	person in society, they are demanding change. <br />
	<br />
	Despite this, many women still do not feel comfortable or capable of
	voicing their concerns or complaints, thinking it is impossible, too
	hard or not within their rights to challenge or question a doctor.
	Additionally many women feel and are told that if their baby is healthy
	then the way they were treated is justified.<br />
	<br />
	How a woman is treated in birth is important to her and her baby as how
	she feels directly impacts her ability to mother well. Medical
	negligence, lack of informed consent and rape in birth is often in the
	form of: <br />
	<br />
	1. Incorrect diagnosis of an emergency, leading to unnecessary medical
	interventions or caesarean surgery. <br />
	2. A fabrication of an emergency by incorrect use of technology and a
	language of fear. <br />
	3. Treatment given without informed consent, omission of information,
	over-riding a refusal of treatment, misrepresentation of a medical
	situation. While the majority of courts have held that the state may not
	force women to undergo unwanted cesareans many women continue to find
	that they are pressured or coerced into such procedures, or they find
	that no health care provider will support their decision to have a
	vaginal birth after a c-section ("VBAC"). Additionally often it is not
	made clear which birthing practices a doctor follows, thus it is
	difficult for women to correctly choose the doctor which suits their
	birth beliefs. Worst still some may listen and agree and accept a
	womanâ€™s birth plans but do something very different at the time of
	birth.<br />
	4. Rude, abusive or violent treatment. Abusive behavior toward women,
	especially in childbirth, is unacceptable and harmful. Includes threats,
	scolding, slapping and hitting, being tied down or forced to lie down,
	coercion, yelling, belittling, lying, manipulating, mocking, dismissing,
	refusing to acknowledge, It is known as Birth Rape! It is your right to
	give birth with dignity and respect. <br/><a

	<h2>2. WAYS TO HEAL.</h2>
	<b>1. Join a support network.</b> We do not have a birth trauma support
	network in Mumbai at present but it only takes a few to start this.
	There are many blogs and WEB based support services. <br />
	<br />
	<a href="http://www.Tabs.org.nz">www.Tabs.org.nz</a> - Dealing with trauma,
	post natal depression and birth stress <br />
	<a href="http://www.birthtraumaassociation.org.uk">http://www.birthtraumaassociation.org.uk</a><br />
	<br />
	<b> 2. Write your birth story</b> â€“ This is beneficial for three reasons
	<br />
	A. As a healing process for women who fell traumatized by their birth
	experiences, often unraveling the truth can be very healing. <br />
	B. To educate others. <br />
	C. To affect changes in maternity services and law at the government
	level. <br />
	D. Birth stories can be used in a court of law if you wish to proceed
	with a suit. <br />
	<br />
	A. Post your story on blogs â€“ send it to your friends, get it published
	in news papers or magazines. Send it to you doctor and hospital, your
	local MP or human rights/ consumer rights lobbying groups. <br />
	Find the contact information for your state medical board (name may
	vary) and send it to them. (See contact below). <br />
	<br />
	B. Birth stories have become an important tool in birth education. They
	are a form of opening up an honest dialogue and thus we become more
	comfortable with the language of birth and the reality of birth. Very
	few urban women today understand what real birth looks like. Much of our
	understanding of birth comes from the media where it is presented as
	either comedy or high emergency drama and society and families mostly
	remain hush hush about the event. Seeing real birth and hearing the real
	stories of birth helps us to birth naturally - without that we are
	fearful and easily manipulated at our most vulnerable moment in life â€“as
	they say Knowledge is power! <br />
	<br />
	C. Birth stories are also political. Many women write of their
	experiences and send it to their local MP. The more women do this the
	more likely state level policies in maternity care will change. <br />
	<br />
	D. Dated personal hand written narrative can be used in court. Have your
	statement notarized by a public notary. Ask anyone else who witnessed
	the events to do the same â€“ write it down, sign and date it. Collective
	action â€“ if other women have experienced the same make a complaint
	together. In birth stories incorporate, medical facts and statistics.
	Back up evidence with your surgical report (all hospitals must hand this
	over - all it takes is a letter of request). <br />
	Find the â€œconsumersâ€� or â€œcomplaintsâ€� or â€œpatients rightsâ€� whom can give
	you information on how to file a complaint. <br />
	Also find the states medical practice act and the professional code of
	conduct and the Obstetricians & Gynecologists ethics statement this will
	help you to determine where you medical providers broke laws and codes
	of practice. Lodge a complaint with the doctors Registration body,
	Indian medical council, or your local medical council <br /><br/>

	<i>I have taken an extract from the consumer guidance society web
	page which relates to our cause:</i> <br />
	<br />
	<h3><b>THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT ENSHRINES</b></h3>
	<b>THE FOLLOWING RIGHTS OF CONSUMER</b>
	<ul>
		<li>Right to be protected from hazardous goods and services</li>
		<li>Right to be informed about the quality and performance of
		goods and services</li>
		<li>Rights to free choice of goods and services</li>
		<li>Right to be heard in decision making process concerning
		consumer interests</li>
		<li>Right to redressal if consumer rights are infringed</li>
		<li>Right to consumer education</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<b>THE PATIENT AS A CONSUMER</b><br />
	Traditionally, patients in India have unquestioning trust in their
	doctors. Most doctors deserve it. But in some cases, medical negligence
	has resulted in severe harm physical, mental and financial. In addition,
	unqualified practitioners have brought suffering to gullible patients.
	Doctors have been liable to prosecution in civil court, but few
	malpractice victims sue for compensation, fearing years (even decades)
	of costly litigation. Fortunately, in 1995 the Supreme Court decreed the
	medical profession to be a "service" under the Consumer Protection Act,
	1986. It set aside a writ Petition challenging the same by the Indian
	medical Association. <br />
	<br />
	<b>WHAT IS MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE?</b><br />
	Medical negligence is defined as a failure to exercise reasonable skill
	and care in diagnosis and treatment as per the prevalent standards as
	that particular point of time. An aggrieved patient who believes that he
	is a victim of medical negligence can now approach the Consumer Courts
	for fair compensation, and expect results in a relatively shorter period
	of two to three years. The procedure is comparatively simple and
	inexpensive. <br />
	Complaints up to 2 years old can be accepted. <br />
