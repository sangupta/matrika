	<h1>When Giving Birth, Opting to Go It Alone</h1>

	Matthew Jasper, 35, a poet from Farmington, N.H., had a brainstorm.
	After the birth of his second child, he said to his wife, "Next time why
	don't we do this by ourselves?" So they did. At 5:30 in the evening on
	April 11, 1999, Beatrice Jasper delivered Eudora in the playroom. The
	videotape camera was rolling. Mr. Jasper and their two sons, 2 and 4,
	watched. <br />
	<br />
	"My first child was born in the hospital and the second at home with
	midwives," Mrs. Jasper said. "This just seemed the next logical step.
	When I was 7 months pregnant, I got on the Internet and found all of
	these references. The more I read, the more it became clear that this is
	what we needed to do. To have a mother's hands be the first ones to
	touch her baby seems so important to me." <br />
	<br />
	The Jaspers were alone at the birth of their daughter, but far from
	alone in the birthing style. They are linked to a close-knit network of
	parents across the United States and abroad who are choosing
	do-it-yourself deliveries. The parents call it unassisted childbirth.
	National statistics are not available, but the Internet provides an
	abundance of Web sites, chat groups and links to books and home videos.
	About 40 couples have gathered at two national conferences, the first in
	1998 in Charleston, S.C., and the second in July in Louisville, Colo. At
	the meetings and on the Web, women who have unassisted births share
	their accounts and photographs and offer advice on practical matters,
	like cutting an umbilical cord. <br />
	<br />
	The movement for unassisted birth is small. It hardly rates being
	described as a movement. But it demonstrates, in an extreme fashion, a
	dissatisfaction that some women perceive with obstetrics. Millions of
	new mothers are grateful for their prenatal care and the obstetrical
	expertise that helped them through difficult deliveries. But there also
	seems to be a yearning for more naturalness to childbirth, that most
	natural of life's events, and a feeling by some women that the emotional
	support that they crave in pregnancy is somehow lacking. <br />
	<br />
	Those women often use midwives or birthing centers. But now a few, to
	the dismay of many physicians and nurses, are choosing to give birth
	solo. The women say they are not fighting the establishment, but simply
	avoiding it. Many do not even have prenatal care. <br />
	<br />
	Doctors strongly object. But the women say they believe that they are
	making the healthiest choice for themselves and their babies. Husbands
	help some of the women, but many mothers do not want any help. They
	usually squat, allowing gravity to ease the baby through the birth
	canal, and then reach down and let the baby wriggle into their hands.
	When everything goes smoothly, babies will glide out of a mother without
	nudging by a doctor or nurse. <br />
	<br />
	"We know 20 percent of all previously normal pregnancies turn into
	complications and high-risk situations during the course of labor that
	could result in serious adverse outcome to mother and baby, including
	death," the president of the American College of Obstetrics and
	Gynecology, Dr. Thomas Purdon, said. "I cannot imagine a woman in the
	United States wanting to take that chance." Dr. Purdon, also a professor
	of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the Arizona Health Sciences
	Center in Tucson, said he sympathized with women who were uncomfortable
	with the coldness and sterility of some hospitals. But he said
	obstetricians and nurse midwives had recently made major efforts to make
	birthing rooms cozier and to intervene medically as little as possible.
	<br />
	<br />
	No statistics are available on complications after unassisted births,
	because many women do not tell their doctors that they are delivering
	their own babies. Deanne Williams, executive director the American
	College of Nurse-Midwives, said she could not condone unassisted births,
	but understood the desire. "I think we are taking a turn for the worse
	where women are not getting the personalized attention they need," Ms.
	Williams said. "We made gains in the 90's in the number of nurse
	midwives and women's voices grew, and hospitals really started to pay
	attention. But now I think there is a push to more technology. These
	women feel empowered to make a statement, but it is a sad statement. The
	majority of births are normal and healthy. So it's hard to appreciate
	that things can go wrong." <br />
	<br />
	Although people involved in unassisted birth networks vary in age,
	education, religion and geography, they have similar attitudes about
	pregnancy, delivery and child rearing. They say a vast majority of
	complications are inflicted, not prevented, by doctors. Mothers say they
	are relaxed in pregnancy and labor because they focus on the pleasures
	of creating life rather than dwelling on dangers, an attitude that they
	say lets them avoid pain. <br />
	<br />
	Delivering one's baby is not illegal, according to the American College
	of Nurse-Midwives. But in some states, including New York, an unlicensed
	midwife is not allowed to deliver a baby without a physician or licensed
	nurse midwife present. That means that women can do whatever they want
	themselves. Women who have delivered their own babies know they can
	always report that the baby was born accidentally, not intentionally,
	without help. <br />
	<br />
	Dr. Charlotte G. Borst, who wrote "Catching Babies: The
	Professionalization of Childbirth 1870-1920," published in 1995, said,
	"The sad part to me is that there is no historical precedent for doing
	it alone." Even before the days of midwives, women had groups of friends
	or relatives nearby. Dr. Borst, also a professor of history and the dean
	of arts and sciences at Union College in Schenectady, N.Y., said she was
	"sort of astonished that any woman would choose to give birth alone." <br />
	<br />
	Shira Levy, 40, of Weston, Fla., a mother of three, said she had
	initially planned an unassisted birth but went to a hospital when she
	learned that she was carrying twins. Ms. Levy delivered her third baby
	at home without medical help. "I gave birth squatting down on the left
	side of the bed with all sorts of sheets and waterproof things," she
	recalled. "My husband caught him, and we cut the cord about an hour
	later with dental floss and sterilized scissors. We didn't call anyone
	until that evening. We just wanted to be our little family." <br />
	<br />
	Lori and Marc, a couple from upstate New York who asked to be identified
	by just their first names, had a "lotus birth." They did not cut the
	umbilical cord. It stayed attached to the mother and baby for two days
	and then dropped off. "I personally wouldn't videotape myself," Lori
	said. "But I am grateful to women who have, because it helped me to get
	rid of the ideas of what birth is. I think women are creating their own
	fears. I am not denying that things could happen. We just didn't think
	about it." <br />
	<br />
	Laura Kaplan Shanley of Boulder, Colo., author of "Unassisted
	Childbirth," published in 1994, has delivered five babies by herself.
	One was born five weeks early and died of a congenital heart defect
	shortly after birth. Ms. Shanley said a coroner told her that the baby
	would have died even if she had gone to a hospital. <br />
	<br />
	Home videos of Mrs. Jasper and Ms. Shanley, along with those of other
	women, appear in a documentary, "A Clear Road to Birth," directed and
	produced by Judy Seaman. "I gained tremendous respect for their courage
	to go against the grain of society," Ms. Seaman said. "After meeting the
	women who chose this kind of birth experience, I think the important
	ingredient is the acknowledgment that this is her birth and that she
	does not have to follow a blueprint." <br />
	<br />
	Mrs. Jasper delivered her fourth child, Albion, on Feb. 25 at 6:53 p.m.
	"After Dora's birth," Mrs. Jasper said, "one of the first things I said
	was: `That was fun. I want to do it again.' "
