	<h3>Summary</h3>
	This analysis of data from Listening to Mothers II focuses primarily on
	postpartum pain according to mode of delivery and whether the respondent
	was pimiparous (having her first baby) or multiparous (having a
	subsequent baby). Listening to Mothers II reports on the experiences of
	a nationally representative sample of 1,573 U.S. women interviewed in
	early 2006 who gave birth in 2005. <br />
	<br />
	In the first two months, 86% of primiparous women who had undergone
	cesarean surgery reported incision pain as a problem (45% "major"
	problem) while among multiparous women, 97% of women having their first
	cesarean reported a painful cesarean incision (44% "major" problem) as
	did 68% of women having a repeat cesarean (22% "major" problem).
	Experience of incision pain did not differ by whether surgery occurred
	before or during labor. <br />
	<br />
	Painful perineum was more common among women having instrumental vaginal
	deliveries compared with spontaneous birth. Among primiparous women who
	had given birth vaginally, similar percentages reported pain with
	instrumental vaginal delivery as with spontaneous birth (77% vs. 73%),
	but significantly more women with instrumental delivery reported
	perineal pain to be a major problem (47% vs. 28%). Significantly more
	multiparous women having instrumental delivery reported both perineal
	pain (52% vs. 37%) and that the pain was a major problem (17% vs. 8%).
	Women having spontaneous birth with no episiotomy fared best of all. <br />
	<br />
	Among primiparous women, 67% reported perineal pain compared with 82% of
	women having episiotomy, although similar percentages reported severe
	pain. Among multiparous women, 33% with no episiotomy reported perineal
	pain compared with 49% of women having an episiotomy, and 5% versus 18%
	reported pain as a major problem. Differences achieved significance in
	the multiparous group but not the primiparous group. <br />
	<br />
	Women were also asked the extent to which pain interfered with routine
	activities in the first two months. In the primiparous group, 12% of
	women having spontaneous vaginal birth said that pain interfered "quite
	a bit" or "extremely" compared with 33% of women having instrumental
	vaginal delivery and 25% of women having cesarean surgery. In the
	multiparous group, 8% of women having spontaneous birth, 8% having
	instrumental delivery, 34% having primary cesarean, and 16% having
	repeat cesarean reported pain interfered to this degree. Differences
	within parity groups achieved significance. Finally, women having
	spontaneous vaginal birth rarely experienced long-term pain, but
	substantial percentages of women having instrumental or surgical
	delivery did. <br />
	<br />
	Only 2% of primiparous women and 1% of multiparous women with
	spontaneous birth reported perineal pain lasting six months or more
	compared with 15% of primiparous women having instrumental vaginal
	delivery, although there were only 40 women in this category, which
	weakens confidence in this result. (None of the 48 multiparous women
	having instrumental delivery experienced long-term pain.) Among women
	having cesarean surgery, 17% of primiparous women, 22% of multiparous
	women having a first cesarean, and 17% of women having repeat cesarean
	surgery experienced pain lasting six months or more. <br />
	<br />
	Significance for Normal Birth: One argument made for elective cesarean
	surgery is that it avoids the pain of labor. Its proponents also allege
	that surgery occurring before labor offers advantages over intrapartum
	surgery. This study, however, finds that women having cesarean surgery
	are more likely to experience pain that interferes with routine
	activities and to experience long-term pain than women birthing
	vaginally and that timing of the surgery makes no difference. <br />
	<br />
	Women considering elective surgery to avoid labor pain should be advised
	that while labor pain can be controlled, cesarean surgery substantially
	increases their risk of experiencing many months of pain postpartum or
	pain that affects their quality of life. Instrumental vaginal delivery
	likewise increases the probability of experiencing perineal pain in both
	the short and long term compared with spontaneous vaginal birth. Women
	may wish to consider this when deciding whether to have an epidural, a
	procedure that increases likelihood of instrumental delivery
	(Anim-Somuah et al., 2005). Episiotomy, too, increases risk of
	short-term pain. <br />
	<br />
	In short, women wishing to avoid childbirth-related pain should be
	advised that a spontaneous vaginal birth with no episiotomy will best
	achieve that goal. Care practices that safely optimize the likelihood of
	spontaneous vaginal birth, including the six care practices that support
	normal birth, should be the standard of care for all childbearing women.
