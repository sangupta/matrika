        A University of California study that included 250 pregnant women showed 
        that an infant's birth weight may be affected by the amount of social 
        support the mother receives during pregnancy. The women were asked if 
        the baby's father would help them financially and otherwise with the baby, 
        if their parents would be there for them, and if they had friends to turn 
        to for support and assistance. The study found that women with several 
        types of support from various sources during pregnancy had higher birth 
        weight infants. The relationship between social support and birth weight 
        held even after the researchers took into account other factors often 
        associated with low birth weight, including premature delivery, a history 
        of stillbirth or spontaneous abortion, and medical conditions such as 
        hypertension or epilepsy. The researchers speculated that social support 
        may alter responses of the nervous system to stress and improve fetal 
        growth. Social support may also inspire healthier behaviors and lifestyles 
        among pregnant women and discourage high-risk behaviors such as smoking, 
        substance use, and poor nutritional intake. Pregnant women with more social 
        support may also be more likely to receive treatment for diseases associated 
        with low infant birth weight. </font></font></font> </p>
